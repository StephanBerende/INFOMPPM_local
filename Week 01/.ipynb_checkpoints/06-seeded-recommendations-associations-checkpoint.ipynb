    "# ðŸ“š Recommendations based on Frequently Reviewed Together (association rules)\n",
    "For the final segment of this assignment, refer to section 5.4 of the _Practical Recommender Systems_ book (pages 113-127). After reading, download the code provided by the book and focus on the `association_rules_calculator.py` in the `builder` directory. Your task is to adapt this code for use in this notebook, translating its steps into a format suitable for our environment. Here's a simplified outline based on the source code:\n",

Too strict will result in fewer associations."

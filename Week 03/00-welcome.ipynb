    "# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to a practical implementation of diversity ðŸ‘‹ \n",
    "Your task this week is to create a movie recommendation system using a dataset of movie plots. The goal is to recommend movies that are not only similar to a given movie but also diverse in their content. You will experiment with and apply concepts of text vectorization, cosine similarity, intra-list similarity, and diversity scoring.\n"

    "### The dataset\n",
    "This assignment uses the [Wikipedia Movie Plots](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) dataset. The dataset contains descriptions of 34,886 movies from around the world. Column descriptions are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Release Year - Year in which the movie was released\n",
    "- Title - Movie title\n",
    "- Origin/Ethnicity - Origin of movie (i.e. American, Bollywood, Tamil, etc.)\n",
    "- Director - Director(s)\n",
    "- Plot - Main actor and actresses\n",
    "- Genre - Movie Genre(s)\n",
    "- Wiki Page - URL of the Wikipedia page from which the plot description was scraped\n",
    "- Plot - Long form description of movie plot (WARNING: May contain spoilers!!!)"

    "\n",
    "* Data Preparation and Preprocessing:\n",
    "  - Load the dataset and explore its structure.\n",
    "  - Clean and preprocess the data as needed. Focus on the 'Plot' and 'Genre' columns for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Engineering:\n",
    "  - Combine relevant features to create a unified text representation for each movie. Suggested features to combine include 'Plot' and 'Genre'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vectorization:\n",
    "  - Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize the combined text features of each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarity Calculation:\n",
    "  - Calculate the cosine similarity between movies based on their vectorized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diversity Scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For each movie, calculate a diversity score as $\\text{Diversity Score =}$ $1 - \\text{average cosine similarity}$\n",
    " with all other movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recommendation Generation:\n",
    "  - Implement a function to generate movie recommendations for a given movie. The recommendations should be based on both similarity (movies should be similar to the given movie) and diversity (recommendations should be diverse).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analysis:\n",
    "  - Analyze the differences between the recommendations generated with and without the diversity adjustment.\n",
    "  - Discuss how the diversity_factor influences the recommendation outcomes.\n",
    "  - Reflect on the potential benefits and drawbacks of introducing diversity into recommendation systems."

    "* Similarity Score Calculation:\n",

    "* Diversity Metric Implementation:\n",
    "  - Implement the diversity_metric function as provided in the earlier code below. This function should adjust the similarity scores based on the diversity_factor to introduce diversity into the recommendations.\n",

    "* Recommendation Generation:\n",
    "  - Select a few items (e.g., movies or books) as the basis for generating recommendations.\n",
    "  - Apply the diversity_metric to the cosine similarity matrix to adjust the similarity scores.\n",
    "  - For each selected item, generate two sets of recommendations: one using the adjusted similarity scores and another using the original cosine similarity scores.\n",

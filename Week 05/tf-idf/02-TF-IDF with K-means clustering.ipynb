    "Sci-kit's `sklearn` library has both _TF-IDF_ and K-means clustring functionality which we can use in conjunction together. As you can see below, the `TfidfVectorizer` can be used to compute _TF-IDF_ out of a list of documents (plots in our case). Interestingly, the vectorizer has both stop_words and preprocessor functionalities, something that ressembles the types of string manipulation we did in the previous section. When the `tfidf` matrix (yes, it is a matrix here) is computed, `KMeans` is used to cluster documents according to the content of their respective `tfidf` vector. "

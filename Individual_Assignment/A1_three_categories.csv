Can the team prove it’s an eighteenth-century work by the artist Benjamin West?;The team head to the beautiful island of Anglesey at the northernmost tip of Wales, where Huw Lewis has a sheep farm. Huw  frequently spends his evenings scouring the internet for art bargains and was trawling through eBay when he came across a small, unattributed oil sketch of Jesus and the apostles at the Last Supper. He immediately sensed it was something special and was amazed when nobody bid against him. He secured it for just £50. He later learned that it had been in the seller’s family for decades, and they had assumed it to be practically worthless. After doing some online research of his own, Huw thought he might have identified the artist as Benjamin West. Born in Pennsylvania, West left America in his twenties and settled in Britain, where he quickly found fame and fortune. By the late eighteenth century, he was one of the most celebrated artists of the day, renowned for the bold storytelling of his history paintings. Perhaps his biggest fan was King George III, who made West his official history painter. Together they aimed to bring about a magnificent new era in British art.   Huw’s picture is an unusual one, as it is a small canvas that appears to be semi-finished. It’s partly painted in oils, but also visible are bold, black lines delineating the figures. After examining the picture closely, Philip is intrigued by it but is also worried by its condition. It appears to have been scrubbed in places, and layers of dirt have built up over the years. There’s also no signature, which, given West was very good at promoting himself and his work, is concerning. But Fiona discovers that Benjamin West was commissioned by King George III to paint two paintings of the Last Supper for chapels at Windsor Castle, and at the Royal Academy of Arts she discovers that one of the preparatory sketches for those paintings hasn’t been seen for a century. Could it be that Huw’s internet bargain is the missing West sketch? Forensic science will be key, as a genuine eighteenth-century picture could reveal some more unusual ingredients, and West was known to experiment with paints. At her laboratory in the Courtauld Institute of Art, Professor Aviva Burnstock examines the picture and reveals some surprising details that the naked eye would never see. But this proves to be one of the team’s most difficult investigations. As well as the worrying condition of the picture, they face a provenance trail that should stretch back more than two hundred years. There’s also the added challenge of doing research in the midst of lockdown. With the odds so stacked against them, can they prove that Huw’s internet bargain is actually a long-lost work fit for a king?

Catherine Bray explores bisexual representation in film;People who are actually attracted to more than one gender are everywhere in the real world, whether they decide to call themselves straight, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual — or prefer not to label their sexuality. But bisexuality is more often hinted at or implied in cinema, and when bisexuality is mentioned by name, it’s not always exactly flattering. But just because the movies don’t feature loads of out and proud bisexuals in lead roles, doesn’t mean bisexual behaviour, coded or otherwise, isn’t a big part of cinema — whether or not the B-word is ever mentioned. Catherine Bray looks at bisexuality onscreen, to see how bisexuals have been characterised — and mischaracterised — in pop culture.

Inextricably entwined and icons of their age, they were both creative powerhouses and gay men, who dealt with success and its evanescence in vastly different ways.Film-maker Lisa Immordino Vreeland brings these two forces together in a unique and fascinating head-to-head, comparing and contrasting their trajectories through duelling voices – the writers’ own, culled from archival footage, and those of actors Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto, who portray Capote and Williams at various stages of their lives. Both writers constructed rich, imaginary worlds and characters - Blanche DuBois and Holly Golightly to mention just two - which left indelible marks on the era. Both men also paid the price of colossal success and fame, suffering alcoholism and periods of artistic stagnation.

At 58, Donny was released from solitary and had his first parole board hearing in April 2018. But for 24 years of his prison life, he was ‘buried alive’ in an 11-by-seven-foot concrete cell inside the Super Max Security Housing Unit of Pelican Bay State Prison, where creativity and the making of art were crucial to Donny’s survival. Together with thousands of other long-time solitary confined prisoners, Donny was denied all physical contact with other human beings, and subjected to sensory and social deprivation. He was permitted to speak to visitors only via a phone through bullet-proof glass. Nevertheless, in 2002, against all the odds and through an initial ‘prisoners pen-pal’ contact and subsequent weekly correspondence with a New York writer and psychoanalyst, Stephen Kurtz, Donny began an intense and mutually transforming friendship. This relationship, expressed through over 500 letters, lies at the heart of this film. And while Donny revealed himself to be a fluent and incisive writer, even more remarkably, with encouragement from Steve, he became a dedicated artist – despite being refused access to conventional painting materials and forced to make brushes from his own hair, and to synthesise his pigments from the coloured sugar coatings of M&M’s and Skittles. As Donny himself cannot be interviewed, his life and emotionally charged journey of self-discovery are presented in the film via quotations from his many letters, read by the award-winning American actor Stanley Tucci. Donny’s ‘voice’ thus becomes the driving force of the documentary, articulating its main themes and topics, from his childhood to the present. Interwoven with Donny’s own words are vivid and articulate contributions from people involved in his life, among them his mother Helen Grimes, his now close friend Steve Kurtz, and his San Francisco-based prisoners' rights lawyer Charles Carbone. A further emotional level is added through music, in the form of specially recorded jazz/rock improvisations for electric guitar and a few songs that have particular significance for Donny.Donny’s life is an example of one man’s resilience and personal transformation, achieved in defiance of a prison system that locks up more of its citizens – mostly the poor – than any other country. And this unusual and provocative film celebrates creativity and friendship as the essential routes to self-realisation for prisoners whose humanity is systematically denied. Whether ‘indefinite confinement’ continues to be Donny’s fate was determined by a parole board hearing held in California’s High Desert State Prison on 19 April 2018. Despite evidence of Donny’s rehabilitation while in prison, his parole was not granted, with even a second hearing denied for a further five years. While the hearing could not be filmed, the tension leading up to the board’s decision, and its momentous emotional repercussions for Donny, his family and everyone else in his life, constitute the moving last sequence of the film.

Specially for this documentary, he has been filmed creating an extraordinary new work: a canvas 30 feet long and seven feet high, on which self-portraits and classic characters emerge in the instantly recognisable, energetic and ebullient style that has taken root in the imaginations of successive generations of children and parents.  Quentin Blake turns 89 in December 2021. His first book was published 61 years ago, and over 500 volumes later, he is still hard at work, drawing every day and determined to break down the barriers between illustration and ‘fine arts’. As he looks back for the first documentary to be dedicated to his life, Blake shares his pleasure in the blank page, the scratch of a quill, and the enjoyable mischief and chaos of childhood. Some of his closest collaborators and biggest admirers pay tribute – among them David Walliams, Michael Rosen, Lauren Child, Chris Riddell, Steven Appleby, Dapo Adeola, Josie Long and Emma Chichester Clark.  There are also readings of works Blake has illustrated, performed by Joanna Lumley, Peter Capaldi and Ore Oduba.

From the 1980s onwards, he withdrew from media and public life. Now his widow Anne speaks for the first time.;The playwright Brian Friel stands among the giants of Irish literature. He sits alongside Irish writing greats such as Heaney, Beckett and Yeats. His plays Faith Healer, Philadelphia Here I Come! and Translations took Irish theatre in completely new directions, while Dancing at Lughnasa brought it to totally different audiences.Yet an unwillingness to talk to the press and a withdrawal from public life in the mid 1980s mean that many have not understood how influential he was and remains. This film sets out to show how Brian Friel redefined Irish theatre in the second half of the 20th century, with his widow Anne giving intimate access to previously non-public family photos, Brian's writing room, original notebooks and copies of first drafts of plays.Artistic director of the Abbey Theatre Caitríona McLaughlin directs a workshop of actors reading extracts from Friel plays, highlighting his exploration of his era’s concerns around cultural identity, social change and political turmoil, the importance of language and the significance of history on the island of Ireland. Those ideas still resonate today. In a post-Brexit world, Friel’s work has never been more relevant.

He then moves to 16th-century Venice, where masterpieces such as Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria altarpiece and Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne contested the assumption that drawing would always be superior to colouring. As the Baroque took hold in enlightenment Europe another Venetian, Giambattista Tiepolo, created a ceiling fresco Apollo and the Four Continents at the Bishop's palace in WÃ¼rzburg.In a glorious sequence Simon celebrates this grand opera of light, colour, and dancing line: a dizzying lift-off into 18th-century elation. But if light could open the gates of ecstasy it could also drop art into the abyss. Francisco Goya began by working in the Venetian tradition but in the last years of his life his Black Paintings drained colour from the world of light. The art of colour discovered a new mission which somehow sustained the old: how to make life in cities bearable, even beautiful. Simon travels to Japan to where in the 18th and 19th century an urban explosion generated a demand for cheap, mass produced woodblock prints suffused with dazzling colour. These prints by artists such as Hokusai were hugely influential on the impressionists and postimpressionists. Simon ends the film in Matisse's great chapel at Vence, where colour is used - against a backdrop of the Second World War - once more to enrapture, enlighten and as a path to God.

This is the inside story of its climb back to reopening.;The series begins in spring 2019, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in its pomp – the coffers full, visitor numbers are up and staff preparing to mark, in one year's time, the museum’s 150th anniversary. The museum has long been planning a series of stand-out exhibitions and events. The art press gather for a breakfast in the American Wing sculpture court, surrounded by treasures reflecting the tastes of the philanthropist founders of the Metropolitan. These were new-money industrialists and financiers, who believed that the lives of New York's teeming millions would be improved by their proximity to beauty. That beauty, however, was vested almost exclusively in the European arts and the artefacts of classical civilisations. The museum is aware that the tastes of the Gilded Age aren't for everyone, and a dance display by the House of Gorgeous shows they're awake to the woke.In his fifth-floor office sits Met president and CEO Dan Weiss, the art historian recently appointed to steer the largest art museum in the Americas out of a period of falling visitor numbers and financial turbulence. Overlooking Central Park, he revels in a painting by Alfred Sisley, a print of which once graced his college digs. Those who built the Met in 1870 wanted an American Louvre, an audacious vision, he says, considering they had no art. The likes of JP Morgan, a previous president, simply spent and lent big, snapping up artefacts all over the world and donating their own collections. Weiss is also spending big for next year's special exhibitions and, with the Met’s director Max Hollein, planning a slew of great events. He's also splashing out on capital projects like the new six-acre glass roof for the European Paintings gallery, at $150m, just one improvement that will make 2020 a landmark year.  The inner workings of the Met are revealed with excursions into various departments, and the warren of labs, workrooms and archives above and deep below the public areas. In the Arms and Armour workshops, they're repairing gauntlets before sending some of their massive collection off to Vienna, and preparing for the arrival from Europe of new old iron and steel for a great show of German armour, The Last Knight.There's more quiet frenzy in the Costume Institute. The conservators have just recovered from the 2019 Met Gala, the starry night where celebrities parade for the camera and make the donations that fund this department. Staff have just delivered this year’s annual show, Camp, a pink celebration of costume drama that is pulling in the crowds. In the next room, they're amassing black garments for the monster 2020 show currently being crafted by British uber-designer Es Devlin.  The film drills deepest into preparations for a show about British mercantile expansion and its impact on interior design. Assistant curator Dr Wolf Burchard has been spirited from the National Trust to Fifth Avenue, his mission: to tell a 500-year story of enterprise from the Tudor to Victorian eras. The museum's existing British galleries are being remodelled for the occasion, and Burchard and his team must navigate the construction works to create a display of 700 items. They've got a £20m budget and seven months.  Two floors up, colleagues face similar time challenges as they build the keystone exhibition Making the Met. It tells the tale of the museum's 15 decades using objects from every department, and new ones donated by sponsors and benefactors. Outside, Austrian Max Hollein, only a few months in post, leads the drive to make the Met feel more modern, diverse and inclusive. For the first time since the austere Beaux-Arts building opened, niches in the exterior are filled with art - a series of bronzes by Kenyan-born artist Wangechi Mutu. She tells how groundbreaking this initiative is.  The Met is on a roll. We are with the glitterati flocking across the Upper East Side for a private viewing of the British exhibition. The public opening of the new galleries, on 2 March 2020, heralds the start of the 150th year programme. Curator Burchard says how strange it feels to have his galleries packed with thousands.  That very same night, the first victim of Covid-19 is in hospital. Within days, the Met will be the first large institution in the city to lock down. As New York becomes a ghost town, viewers are on the inside watching the museum trying to protect one million exhibits from light damage and moths, wrestling with 20 per cent staff cuts and losses of $150m, while working towards a reopening, sometime in an uncertain future. When that day comes, we witness emotional scenes that underline a truth: that New Yorkers regard the Met as their own. More than just a museum, it's a resource and a refuge.

Could it be a work by the Victorian artist Edwin Landseer that was previously thought to have been destroyed by a flood in 1928?;Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould investigate a painting that could be the work of the celebrated artist Sir Edwin Landseer. If it is, they will have rediscovered a much-loved Victorian masterpiece that was thought to have been destroyed by a catastrophic flood almost a century ago. The painting depicts the terrible aftermath of battle, with fallen soldiers and horses evoking the horror of war. The scene, known as Time of War, was first painted in 1846 by Landseer, the artist who created one of the most iconic images of 19th-century British art, The Monarch of the Glen, and whose lion sculptures still sit proudly in Trafalgar Square today. Landseer was an infant prodigy who became a favourite of Queen Victoria, and he painted the royal family and their beloved pets throughout his life.The painting is owned by Kathy and Barry Romeril, who bought it in 1987, when they were still married. Now divorced, the painting has stayed with Kathy at her home in Ascot, while Barry now lives in Florida. The couple first spotted the picture in a sale at Ascot racecourse and had no idea of any connection to Landseer. Kathy explains to Fiona and Philip that she has a love of horses and was moved to tears by the grey horse staring out at her in such a desperate state. She decided there and then that the painting was coming home with her, and she bid £720 to secure it. But if the painting is proven to be a lost national treasure by Landseer, it could be worth as much as £80,000. The original Time of War hung at the Tate gallery in London and was there in 1928 when the city suffered one of the worst disasters in its history. On the night of 7 January, the Thames burst its banks at Lambeth and crashed through the walls of the Embankment, flooding the houses that lined the river at that time. Fourteen people died, and thousands were left homeless. Water also surged into the lower galleries of the Tate, damaging hundreds of works from the national collection. By all accounts Time of War was destroyed - but was that really the case? Could Kathy and Barry’s picture be the lost Landseer? Fiona follows the clues through the archives to establish exactly what happened to Landseer’s original painting. It’s a trail with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, including the revelation that other pictures thought to have been destroyed that night most definitely were not. One very notable example is now on display at the National Gallery. Philip, meanwhile, scours the picture itself for evidence that this is the hand of Landseer. As he casts his expert eye over the large canvas, he can see that the painting has unquestionably been damaged in the past. Could it be evidence of the Tate flooding? The investigation gathers pace, and the evidence is presented, but will it be enough to prove that Kathy and Barry’s picture is a long-lost national treasure?

Although their conversation covers much about the author's influences and ambitions - with the notable exception of any mention of his time as a spy - much of the interview looks at the modern phenomenon of the secret service agent as a hero.In a revealing insight, le Carre explains that his dislike of James Bond stems from the fact that Bond doesn't exist in a political context, making him more of an ""international gangster"" than a spy. Although Malcolm Muggeridge talks about his own, very brief, period of spying, John le Carre remains close-lipped about his (much more extensive) career in espionage. Le Carre (real name David Cornwell) began working for MI5 in 1952 and transferred to MI6 in 1960. There he remained until 1964, when a combination of Kim Philby's defection, which exposed many British agents, and his own growing success as a novelist caused him to leave the secret service. Le Carre remained secretive about his former career for many decades."

Often called art's greatest showman and the world's first celebrity artist, Dali shamelessly used TV to promote his art and himself. Dali's striking, dreamlike images made his name synonymous with surrealism, and he shocked the world through film, fashion, sculpture and architecture.In this account, David hunts through dozens of BBC programmes to try to understand the real Salvador Dali, not just the more familiar eccentric show-off. Taking in films presented down the decades by Robert Hughes, Sister Wendy and Philippa Perry, David's rich dive into the archives, including Dali’s own films, reveals how our understanding of the artist has changed dramatically over the years.Whatever the era, Dali has always been important to programme makers – so much so that on BBC Four’s launch night in 2002, one of the broadcasts was a star-studded and surreal comic exploration of Dali's early career, featuring Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas and Ewen Bremner. David also delves into Dali's fractured relationship with the surrealists and his own family, and his life-long passion for his wife Gala, who was the engine behind his later career and helped him take America by storm.

Could it be a lost work by one of the greatest 20th-century artists?;Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould head to the beautiful Norfolk countryside on the trail of one of the 20th century’s greatest artists, Henry Moore. They are investigating an intriguing sculpture that belongs to retired dairy farmer Neil Betts and his wife Barbara, who, over the years, have used the piece as a doorstop and even a water feature, when Neil draped a hosepipe over it. t was only when a friend suggested it looked very much like the work of Henry Moore that the Betts began to see it in a different light – and started to call it Henry.   Neil and Barbara inherited the sculpture from their former neighbour, Mrs Williams, who at that time lived next door to them at Mergate Hall near Norwich. The sculpture had been found in the long grass of the grounds of the hall when Neil had struck it with his strimmer while helping the Williams family clear the garden. When Mrs Williams died, she left it to the Betts along with all of her possessions.  Things got off to a promising start when Neil and Barbara sent photographs of the sculpture to the Henry Moore Foundation in Perry Green, Hertfordshire. The foundation has the authority to decide whether previously uncatalogued pieces are genuine works by Moore, and they were interested enough in the Betts’ piece to ask them to submit it to their review panel. But first the Fake or Fortune? team are helping the Betts research this distinctive piece and compile a dossier of evidence.  There’s a huge amount at stake. If this is a unique piece by Henry Moore, it could be worth up to £1 million. But if it’s not, then it’s probably worth just a few thousands. The stakes have never been so high for the team.

The second picture is a sympathetic portrayal of Balthazar, a prince and one of the wise men from the Christmas story, which Bendor thinks may be by 16th-century Antwerp master Joos van Cleve. Examination reveals that it was once the left-hand door of a folding altarpiece. Bendor goes on to Edinburgh to see a similar altar, the finest work by van Cleve in Britain. Emma meets Rev Richard Coles to find out how, despite the lack of any description in the Bible, it became traditional to portray Balthazar as a black African.

From 1962 until 1973, she worked at the BBC’s Radiophonic workshop, where she created the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, which remained uncredited in her lifetime.Delia Derbyshire introduced avant-garde electronic sound to a whole generation through the medium of a children’s teatime television show. Sound was both a refuge for Delia and a haunting manifestation of something darker. Delia was three years old during the Coventry blitz listening to the electronic sounds of the air-raid sirens against a backdrop of her devastated hometown. Delia describes the sound of the ‘all-clear' and air-raid sirens as her first experience of electronic music.This is a story where sound encapsulates the pain, violence and potential of modernity and positions Delia as tapping into a heightened realm, where her femininity and creativity are unshackled, amplified and set free. This essence in her music invites aggression and control, often unconsciously, from those around her. Her technical and creative brilliance, intuition and integrity is a threat that speaks to the devastating gender power politics of her age and which still persists today.Delia’s story is told through two archives: the first, a collection of lost works, 267 reels of quarter-inch magnetic tape recordings of Delia’s work found in her attic after her death, the other, her school books, paintings and keepsakes, discovered in her childhood bedroom.The combined archive, which now resides at Manchester's John Rylands library, is an incredible resource of unfiltered material. Delia’s poetic collages and atmospheric soundscapes reveal themselves as intriguing expressions of her extraordinary inner life. The drama begins with Delia Derbyshire as a time traveller and imagines a visitation where she brings with her fragments, objects and sounds from her past to bring her struggle and vision to life, finding solace in deeply personal soundscapes. Her struggle with alcoholism, frustrations at her contribution been downplayed in a predominantly male workplace as well as her intense artistic collaborations and life on the fringes of relationships are all explored in the film - all themes that collapse into sound, texture and harmonies. Delia is portrayed through a mix of observation and imagination. No single perspective would be sufficient to gain a true understanding of Delia. The docudrama replaces biography and a biopic style with something more lyrical.Its playful, psychedelic mix utilises archival materials, interviews with her collaborators and dramatisations while honouring the BBC Radiophonic Workshops arranger-composer's own questing spirit. This is a life story told through sound, using both Delia’s own pieces of music alongside a soundtrack constructed from samples chosen with musician and performance artist Cosey Fanni Tutti from Delia’s attic tapes. It explores the fantasy of a collaboration, an exchange of ideas across eras between two fascinating musicians. It celebrates independence and imagination and looks at how, when that energy is evoked by women and creates a spark, the pattern seen throughout history is that it is often dismissed, ridiculed or downplayed. A cinematic exploration of a legendary musical figure, written and directed by Caroline Catz, who also plays Delia.

Bridget Riley has been challenging our perception through painting for over 60 years, with radical work that has transformed how we look at art and invites us to feel with our eyes. With simple black and white geometric shapes, repeated curves of colour or an array of muted dots, Riley’s work moves, shimmers and - in some cases - unsettles. At the age of 90, Bridget Riley shows no signs of stopping. Her paintings command millions at auction, she has won prestigious awards and honours, and continues to innovate, paint, publish and exhibit around the world. BBC cameras have filmed with Riley over the past few years in two of her studios, on the cliffs of Cornwall, where she spent the Second World War, and at the National Gallery in London during the installation of her enormous mural there in 2018. In a rare and revealing interview with Kirsty Wark, Riley dispels the numerous misconceptions which have followed her throughout her career. Many consider her as a poster girl for the Swinging 60s, while others hail her as a titan of abstract art. However, Riley considers herself a traditional painter who has merely picked up the baton from those who have gone before her, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Monet, Cezanne and Matisse.

Civilisation may be impossible to define, but its opposite - evidenced throughout history in the human urge to destroy - is all too evident whenever and wherever it erupts. Simon Schama explores the remote origins of human creativity with the first known marks made some 80,000 years ago in South African caves - marks which were not dictated merely by humanity's physical needs. He marvels at the later cave works - shapes of hands, in red stencils on the walls of caves, and at the paintings of bison and bulls, and Stone Age carvings.As time passes, the elements of civilisation are assembled - written language, codes of law, and expressions of warrior power forged in metals. And humanity begins to produce art not just for ritual, as Simon discovers in Minoan civilisation. But how do such cultures arise and how do they fall? Simon travels to the civilisations of Petra in the Middle East and the Maya in Central America to explore those questions. He finds that ultimately civilisations depend on humanity's relationship with the environment for their survival, and while all believe in their own continuity, all are doomed to fall.

The documentary features stunning original performances by some of the greatest practitioners of Irish dance of the present day and a wealth of archive materials including films, photographs and witness accounts revealing the history of Irish dance and its evolution. There is a strong American current running throughout the story as we show how the Irish diaspora played a pivotal part in shaping the form, particularly during the last century. Gene Kelly was among those in the Irish diaspora whose style, though strongly American, also drew heavily on his Irish roots. In the worst and best of times, the Irish danced. And as it grew and changed, the Irish dance form was shaped by political and social forces, and by interactions with cultures from across Europe, Africa and America. Irish dance carries with it echoes of many other cultures with which the people of Ireland have interacted.Steps of Freedom features some of the form’s finest dancers, including Jean Butler, Donnie Golden, Edwina Guckian, Jonathan Kelleher, Stephanie Keane, Morgan Bullock, Siobhan Manson, Garreth Coleman, Noel Spillane, Ty Knowlin, William Jackson and Cuthbert Artura. Key musicians who appear in the film include Cormac Begley, Rhiannan Giddens, Liam O Maonlaí, Ronán Ó Sonadaigh, Steve Cooney and Colm Mac Con Iomaire.

The couple who owned this great house back in the 19th century were obsessed with the decorative arts and Hospitalfield is full of ornate carved ceilings, sculpted fireplaces, exquisite plasterwork and stonework carved by master masons. It's still a place where artists work today and it has a fine picture collection. Amongst the many Victorian paintings, could a mysterious 16th-century portrait by one of the great Old Master artists lie waiting to be discovered? Dr Bendor Grosvenor and Emma Dabiri travel to Arbroath to investigate what could be a true Old Master painting, obscured by 400 years of dirt and old varnish. Bendor suspects the painting is a lost masterpiece by giant of Dutch art Antonis Mor, court painter to Philip II of Spain. But with no documentary evidence, it's a hard case to prove. While Bendor travels to Madrid to track down other examples of Mor's work, Emma digs deeper into the double standards of Victorian morals, finds the true story of the couple who made Hospitalfield a haven for artists, and meets the contemporary artists working at Hospitalfield today.

In the art of Piet Mondrian, James explores how an artist who began life as a landscape painter gradually leaves nature behind, tidying up the messy reality of nature into abstract lines. We meet Chinese artist Yang Yongliang on the streets of New York, whose sprawling digital landscapes ask questions about our drive for rapid urbanisation.James continues to explore this story through the images of one of the best photographers of the last century – and one of its most brilliant women - Margaret Bourke-White. In 1930, she was the first professional western photographer to be allowed into the Soviet Union, where she captured the rapid transformation of the country from being largely rural into a modern, industrial state. James moves on to explore how the destructive power of the atomic age both terrified and inspired artists in the 1940s and 1950s, from painters like Bittinger to the world of sci-fi films.We then see the arrival of a new kind of art – land art. In the late 60s and 70s, a growing number of artists left the city and started working not only in nature but with it. We meet two contemporary land artists based in New Zealand: Philippa Jones and Martin Hill, who use natural materials to create sculptures in the landscapes of New Zealand’s South Island. And finally, we explore how artist collective Random International are using technology to explore our future relationship with nature – through a series of mesmerising art works.James finishes the episode and the series asking questions of the interviewees who have appeared across the series. How do they see our future relationship with nature?He concludes that on the long journey we humans have been on since our beginnings, artists have played a vital role not only in reflecting but also shaping our attitudes to nature. They’ve helped us understand its intricacy, appreciate its beauty, and now – when the entire planet seems under threat – they can help us forge a new relationship with it.

Formed in London, the band was comprised of Boy George on vocals, Mikey Craig on bass, Roy Hay on guitar and keyboards and Jon Moss on drums. As well as their UK success, the band was huge in the USA - notching up ten top 40 hits. Being part of Band Aid cemented them as stalwarts of the 80s, a band that broke down barriers and left a huge legacy for the stars that came later, before they disbanded in 1986.  However, they are a band with a past as colourful as their music. George had a secret affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction. Over the years there have been numerous failed attempts to reunite the band. In 2014 Culture Club decided to come back together to record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour. Director Mike Nicholls has unique access, following the band as they first meet in George's London home to write new material. However, it's not long before creative differences and tensions from their past begin to emerge. Faultlines develop further when the band travel to Spain to record the new album, spending two weeks working and living together in a remote recording studio. As the band return to London to prepare for the tour, they suffer a Twitter mauling after their first big public performance on Strictly Come Dancing. Relations are even more strained when George and the band sign to separate managers and a sudden illness threatens the whole reunion. The film looks at the band's troubled past, examining the themes of success, fame and ego, and reveals the personalities behind one of the most iconic bands of all time.

Simon Schama explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world, looking at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity.;Simon Schama begins Civilisations with this premise: that it is in art - the play of the creative imagination - that humanity expresses its most essential self: the power to break the tyranny of the humdrum, the grind of everyday. Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?Using the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit.

He discovers why the new towns are there and how they enticed people out of the bigger cities, and uncovers the surprising ways in which public art changed the new towns and the new towns changed public art.Mark's father, Stan, made sculptures that stand to this day on the streets of Glenrothes, East Kilbride and the Scottish new town that never was, Stonehouse. These new towns employed town artists to make artworks in the very housing precincts the new residents were moving into.Stan Bonnar was the first assistant to seminal town artist David Harding in Glenrothes in the early 70s, then became town artist himself at East Kilbride and Stonehouse Development Corporation later on in the decade. His first new town artwork was the concrete hippos that have stalked Glenrothes for almost 50 years.Scotland’s new town artists were at the forefront of a shift in thinking that changed the relationship between art and public places. Rather than plinths and bronze likenesses of dead soldiers and politicians, this art would be found in playgrounds,  on underpasses, by bus stops, and could be seen out of people’s living room windows. The environment and surroundings of the work were seen as part of the art itself, the context in which the sculptures stand being part of what they have to say. The new town art was there for everyone, designed to define the places it was made and to mean something to the people who lived alongside it.Mark uncovers the relationship between the new towns and their art, tracing a legacy of the approach taken by the development corporations and revealing the impact of the town artists’ work in the communities they were made for. Across Scotland, from Irvine in the west, via East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Glenrothes, Mark travels to talk with former town artists such as David Harding, Malcolm Robertson, Mary Bourne and Denis Barns, and to learn about Brian Miller. On his travels, he finds out how some work has survived, some has been damaged and some lost. This journey takes Mark closer to an understanding of his father’s approach to art and helps him grasp the context and legacy of the towns, the artists and their work.

Curator Will must ensure its good condition before it can be put into storage.With the V&A preparing for a new exhibition on the art of Iran, curator Tim hopes to display some of the longest artworks ever unveiled at the museum: three ten-metre-long replicas of the painted interiors of mosque domes from central Iran, dating from the 1850s and created by local Iranian craftsmen. After more than a century in storage, these vast objects need extensive conservation, but conserator Nicola has only 16 weeks before the they are installed.In the Jewellery Gallery, curator Clare has two new pieces she is hoping to add to the collection. The first is known as the Vulcan ring, made by contemporary British designer Emefa Cole as part of a series inspired by the power and majesty of volcanoes, while the second is the Peony Brooch by Taiwanese designer Cindy Chao, fashioned from 105 large oval rubies held in purple titanium.In the British Galleries, curator Simon has found the perfect object for the Laughing Matters display, which celebrates the history of Britain through comedy: the costume worn by Andrew Sachs in Fawlty Towers. The outfit is being donated to the museum by Sachs’s daughter Kate, who recalls memories of visiting her father on set and reflects on how her father’s own immigrant background escaping from Nazi Germany in 1938 would have informed his portrayal of Barcelonian waiter Manuel.

Catling.;An investigation into the extraordinary life and work of B. Catling, an eye-popping insight into the late-flourishing career of a maverick artist, teacher and performer.;An eye-popping insight into the extraordinary, late-flourishing career of maverick artist, teacher and performer Brian Catling RA, whose unique vision and imagination are celebrated through a shifting narrative of newly restored archive material, exclusive interviews and specially shot footage.Brian Catling was born in 1948, a foundling adopted and raised in tenements on the Old Kent Road in postwar south London. He is an internationally exhibited and lauded sculptor and, as B. Catling, the author of The Vorrh Trilogy, a vast work of untrammelled imagination, and the novel Earwig, which provided the inspiration for Lucile Hadzihalilovic’s 2021 film of the same name. Catling is also a professor at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at the University of Oxford, a royal academician and a Cholmondeley Award-winning poet. He is also the erstwhile impresario of the legendarily disreputable Cabaret Melancholique and an occasional sinister cinematic presence, both in front of and behind the camera. Where Does It All Come From is a window into Catling’s world that, like Catling himself, defies categorisation. It is shaped through a stitching-together of rediscovered archive material with newly shot interviews, fragments of previously unseen filmworks, interjections and interactions, ghosts and revenants. Important locations in Catling’s life and work – south London and Whitechapel, museums, churches, dives, Gozo, Leipzig, Copenhagen – are interwoven with imaginary landscapes and revisited, explored or recreated. Interviews and long-lost performances are remade and repurposed, seances held, dead or vagrant voices resuscitated. Characters, symbols and strange beings – some of whom then reveal their role and purpose – are glimpsed or merely spoken of, sometimes without explanation. At times, fiction hijacks fact to reveal other, deeper truths.We see Catling at work, in the past and the present, in public performance, on stage, conjuring uncanny presences in galleries, abandoned rooms and in his studio. His histories are told, including childhood obsessions with outsiders and monsters, the early days of art school and labouring jobs at Truman’s Brewery, becoming an artist, a sculptor and maker of installations, and his decision to retreat from the London art world.A host of writers, artists, musicians, curators and former students, including actor Ray Winstone recollecting a terrifying encounter in London’s Whitechapel, are also called upon to bear witness to a creative spirit who defies definition and is capable of endless self-reinvention.

An enigmatic and reclusive talent, Siffre wrote the song It Must Be Love, later covered by Madness, alongside songs of defiance like the classic anti-apartheid anthem (Something Inside) So Strong. In a highly unusual and uncompromising creative life, Siffre has produced nine albums to date – a somewhat overlooked back catalogue whose range and quality is nothing short of extraordinary. His hugely impressive body of work has in recent years also proved rich territory for an array of hip-hop heavyweights with Dr Dre and Eminem, Jay Z and Kanye West all discovering and sampling his music, bringing it to an entirely new generation of listeners around the world.

Sam is amazed how few people, outside of his native north east, know much about his hero’s work. He’s now on a mission to win back Hull’s place in music history.In this film, he traces the career of the man whose words and music put Newcastle and supergroup Lindisfarne on the musical map in the 1970s. Alan continued to write classic songs until his early death in 1995. He spoke of love and life, championed the underdog and the misunderstood, and celebrated working-class people and his hometown - both of which he loved with a passion. Alan lived and wrote through turbulent times - writing eloquently about the troubles in Northern Ireland, the Falklands War and the miners’ strike.Sam digs out great archive interviews, performances and unseen footage, and meets friends, family and bandmates who knew Alan Hull best. Sam also hears from top stars like Sting, Elvis Costello, Mark Knopfler, Dave Stewart and Peter Gabriel. All were huge fans of songs such as Lady Eleanor, Fog on the Tyne, Winter Song, Clear White Light and Run For Home. But he also finds that Alan inspired an entire new generation of musicians like Kay Greyson: a young rapper from Tyneside. To his surprise, Sam discovers ‘Hully’ also took the lead role in an acclaimed BBC TV primetime drama. He reveals a complex man - a political animal, a drinker and an agitator, beset by his own insecurities but someone who could break hearts and inspire minds with his lyrics and melodies.

Mary seeks answers to fundamental questions at the heart of ideas about civilisations. Why have human beings always made art about themselves? What were these images for? And in what ways do some ancient conventions of representing the body still affect us now? In raising these questions, Mary explores how the way we look can influence our ideas of what is civilised.The colossal prehistoric Olmec heads in Mexico set the scene. In a culture with no written record, all we can do is puzzle about what these images were for, whom they represented, and why they were constructed. Mary Beard moves to other ancient cultures where more evidence has survived. She looks at images that are far more than art objects - images from Egyptian statues to the terracotta warriors of ancient China that actively participate in the social world, that teach men and women how to behave, that assert power and assuage loss. Mary explores what makes a 'realistic' image of the human form. She looks at the 'Greek Revolution', the extraordinary process in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, which saw the sculpture of the human body dramatically change from a series of static formulaic images to what we now take as living naturalism. Mary shows that Greek ideas of the human form influence the way we look to this day.

He captivates audiences with the power, emotion and beauty of his singing, the intelligence of his acting, his matinee-idol delivery, and his extraordinary range - from the heroic stage roles in Wagner to the intimate songs of Schubert on the concert platform.For this documentary for the BBC's Opera Season, the film-maker John Bridcut has been given unique and often surprising access to Kaufmann across the last two years, observing him in rehearsal, backstage during performances, and in his off-duty moments. It is by far the most intimate and extensive portrait yet made of Kaufmann, now at the peak of his career. He was filmed behind the scenes at the Last Night of the Proms, when he was the first German to sing Rule, Britannia. His schedule was later interrupted for five months because of a vocal injury, but recently he made a triumphant return, notably in the production of Verdi's late opera, Otello, at Covent Garden. Kaufmann is filmed working with the Royal Opera's music director, Sir Antonio Pappano, and the stage director, Keith Warner - and is involved in every aspect of the preparations. He talks freely about his earlier cancellations, about what keeps him going during a run of performances, and about the problems of being a star.John Bridcut has previously made documentary portraits of Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Nureyev, Mstislav Rostropovich and Sir Colin Davis (which was named Best Arts Documentary at the Grierson Awards). His clutch of composer-portraits began with the award-winning Britten's Children and continued with films on Elgar, Delius, Parry and Vaughan Williams. Last year he made the BBC One documentary for the Queen's 90th birthday, Elizabeth at 90 - A Family Tribute.

Emma reveals the true identity of the sitter after 300 years.;Britain’s premier art detectives, Bendor Grosvenor and Emma Dabiri, are on the hunt to find and restore one of the nation’s great lost masterpieces. Can a mysterious painting of a beautiful society woman really be by the celebrated artist Joshua Reynolds? And which celebrity playwright will lead them from Rome to Bath to London’s Royal Academy? With a fascinating treasure hunt into the art of the Georgians and a very modern 21st-century digital restoration, the results are truly spectacular.  Bendor traces the remarkable life of Sir Joshua from humble beginnings in the West Country to reach the pinnacle of the artistic establishment, becoming the first president of the Royal Academy and the country's most respected authority on art. In Rome, Bendor explores how Reynolds developed his style, known as the Grand Manner, and visiting the home of a private collector, he looks at a little-known self-portrait by Reynolds. Bendor explains why he believes it to be the greatest self-portrait ever made by a British artist, with virtuoso brushwork and a fluidity that gives it a remarkably modern appeal. Intensely personal and sympathetic, it was painted when Reynolds was at the height of his success, wealthy enough to buy a large house in the centre of London, lavishly furnished and adapted for his own needs. Bendor is also pleased to see the picture has many similarities to the portrait of Elizabeth Linley. Emma explores the story of the man who donated the picture, Archibald McLellan, a wealthy businessman whose passion for art saw him amass an outstanding collection, which he left to the city of Glasgow. Reynolds's achievements culminated with his presidency of the newly created Royal Academy of the Arts, a position he made his own and which gave him an authority to promote his own opinions about painting. The suite of rooms at Somerset House in the Strand, where the academy was originally housed, have recently been restored. Bendor visits it to get a taste of the spaces that would have been familiar to Reynolds, including the Great Room, where the tradition of the Summer Exhibition was born under Sir Joshua. At the restoration studio, the portrait itself has been subject to close scrutiny. At some point in the last few years, the surface of the painting had been coated with a thick varnish, which has now discoloured and darkened. However, Reynolds's unorthodox painting methods, often using wax instead of oil to mix his paints, mean it must undergo stringent technical analysis to ensure it is safe to clean it. It soon becomes clear it will be impossible to restore the picture, which Bendor feels will damage the prospects of a favourable verdict from the Reynolds expert, Martin Postle. Emma investigates the brief and tragic life of the woman who has always been the accepted subject of the picture, Elizabeth Linley. A child prodigy, she became a celebrity singer performing in her hometown of Bath from the age of nine. In her teens, she was regarded as a great beauty and suffered frequent but unwelcome attention from suitors. She eloped and married the playwright and politician Richard Brindsley Sheridan, and found herself at the centre of a constitutional crisis before her tragic early death at the age of 37. Emma is puzzled to know what evidence there is that the portrait is really Elizabeth, as there have been doubts expressed in the past. When she looks at some of Reynolds's vivid and insightful portraits of female celebrities from the Georgian era, she is surprised when she uncovers the true identity of the sitter in our portrait. To give a sense of how the portrait would look if it had been possible to clean it, and to give his case a boost, Bendor creates a three-dimensional digital facsimile using laser scanning techniques and high-resolution re-colourisation. The portrait is returned to Glasgow for the verdict to be revealed.

David Olusoga explores the artistic reaction to imperialism in the 19th century.;If David Olusoga's first film in Civilisations is about the art that followed and reflected early encounters between different cultures, his second explores the artistic reaction to imperialism in the 19th century. David shows the growing ambivalence with which artists reacted to the idea of progress, both intellectual and scientific, that underpinned the imperial mission and followed the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution.Advances in knowledge and technology imbued Europeans in the 19th century with a sense of their civilisation's superiority. It justified their imperial ideology. But it created among artists deep fascinations with other civilisations which in turn produced a scepticism about their own. By contrast, as European artists questioned their civilisation's 'advance', in America painters sought to capture an idea of their new nation's 'manifest destiny' in landscapes. And in their representation of the Native Americans, they sought to record for posterity the world and the cultures they were violently displacing. But this was not always the case. David show how in New Zealand one artist was co-opted by the Maori who used his sills to record their culture and celebrate their ancestors. As the 19th century came to an end, the certainties of industrial and scientific advance were increasingly questioned - many artists (Gauguin and Picasso amongst them) turned to non-Western art and culture for inspiration. And in the face of the catastrophic conflict of the First World War, the idea that progress, reason and industrial advance were guarantors of higher 'civilisation' was rejected. David ends the film with a powerful meditation on Otto Dix's nightmarish and ironic evocation of the horror of the trenches, the triptych Der Krieg (The War).

It’s this unlikely relationship that provides the inspiration for Afrofuturism, the broad cultural trend that encompasses works by Jean-Michel Basquiat to Grace Jones, Solange Knowles and Sun Ra. In this film, we meet, see and hear from artists across three continents who each, in their own way, explore the Afrofuture to look at the horrors of the black past and imagine alternative futures.The mysterious yet influential Detroit techno duo, Drexciya, take the Atlantic Ocean, a site of death and destruction during the African slave trade and reclaim it as a place of creation and beauty. Through a series of releases from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, they envisage the unborn children of enslaved pregnant women, thrown overboard during the Middle Passage to the Americas, adapting to breathe under water and thrive in a Black Atlantis. The mythos is vividly brought to life by the Drexciyan collaborator and graphic artist Abdul Qadim Haqq as a thriving, technological undersea world.Visual artist Ellen Gallagher similarly transforms the violence of the ocean into rebirth and renewal. Her film Osedax, made with Edgar Cleijne, is an imaginative retelling of how the skeletal remains of dead whales sustain new life in the curious form of the bone-devouring worm of the title. Whereas for artist Hew Locke, as well as the ocean itself, it’s the Atlantic’s coastal fringes that inspire his world of bricolage phantoms, plucked from the ghost stories of a Guyanese childhood. The Afrofuture is perhaps most commonly imagined through the rubric of outer space, thanks in no small part to avant-garde jazz musician and poet Sun Ra.  Born in the southern US in the early 20th century, Ra underwent an interplanetary conversion, claiming to have been teleported to Saturn. As with funk pioneer, George Clinton, who describes a similar close encounter with extraterrestrials, Ra’s identification with an alien presence can be read as more than simple escapism. It’s also a biting satire on the alienating experience of being black in America. For Ra, space is also an alternate destiny for black people, as the title of his 1973 Afrofuturist feature film Space is the Place insists. Reaching beyond these fictional ‘Afronauts’ is the conceptual artist Tavares Strachan. His performance piece, Star City, Training in Six Parts, sees Strachan visit the famous Russian space centre to undergo the same rigorous – and often tortuous – training of the Cosmonauts. Strachan likens one of the exercises, which measures our capacity to withstand disorientation and gravitational stress, to his impoverished upbringing in The Bahamas. The film concludes with an exploration of the idea of double consciousness. Coined in the early 20th century by WEB Du Bois, the influential African American sociologist, double-consciousness describes how black people in western societies see themselves twice over. Through their lived experience but also how they’re perceived within a dominant white culture.Curator and writer Ekow Eshun traces uses of the idea through Ralph Ellison’s lauded mid-20th-century novel Invisible Man, and painter Kerry James Marshall’s image of the same title, right up to the Black Lives Matter movement. Predicated upon recordings of anti-black violence often captured through digital tech, Eshun argues these ‘expose’ a double consciousness at work, the world as experienced and seen through black eyes, laid bare for all to witness. Other artists and commentators featured in the programme include Nuotama Frances Bodomo, Aria Dean, Ayesha Hameed, Kiluanji Kia Henda, Shabaka Hutchings, Elvira Dyangani Ose, Cauleen Smith and Greg Tate.

It is also the story of how the talents of a golden generation of artists were forever preserved on film. Nupen came from an unlikely background in South Africa and ‘ticked none of the boxes’, but seizing upon the emerging camera technology and his unique access, he filmed classical music in a completely new and intimate way that broke down the barriers between artists and their public. As a result, this documentary is also an important story about the history of music on television and the great artists who collaborated on the films.   Now 86, Nupen reflects on 75 productions about artists and composers spanning more than 50 years. His body of work convincingly enforces his conviction that television is capable of remembering artists in a way that no other medium can equal. Oxford philosopher and historian Sir Isaiah Berlin described Nupen’s films as being ‘at just about the highest level which television is capable of reaching’.The programme cherry-picks examples of Christopher Nupen’s best work between 1966 and 2017. When he started, he instinctively blended documentary and musical performance to create a new genre of film. He filmed musicians at close quarters in their natural environment, where they have most to offer. Television picked up the exuberant spirit of the new generation and carried it far and wide. The effects were dramatic and brought countless numbers of people to music for the first time.A musician himself, Nupen’s musical friends were among the most-renowned artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Capturing their unique talents on film, we relive sublime historical moments with the likes of Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman, Andrès Segovia, John Williams, Nathan Milstein, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Kissin and Daniil Trifonov.As Nupen’s experience grew, he tackled musical ideas and the lives of the great composers. His films represent a single-minded dedication to sharing the power of music that will leave a legacy of lasting value.

Are tower blocks, giant supermarkets and an ever expanding suburbia the way forward?

She also challenges the myth that streets are traffic arteries and unsavoury places to be in, especially for children, arguing that it's traffic that's the problem, not kids.

These encounters provoked wonder, awe, bafflement and fear. And, as historian of empire David Olusoga shows, art was always on the frontline. Each cultural contact at this time left a mark on both sides: the magnificent Benin bronzes record the meeting of an ancient West African kingdom and Portuguese voyagers in a spirit of mutual respect and exchange. By contrast we think Spain's conquest of Central America in the 16th century as decimating the Aztecs and eviscerating their culture. But David shows even in Mexico rare surviving Aztec artworks recall a more nuanced story. He travels to Japan to explore how the Tokugawa Shogunate, after an initial embrace, became so wary of outside interference that they sought to cut ties with the outside world. But in their art, as in their trade, they could never truly isolate themselves from foreign influences. By contrast the Protestant Dutch Republic was itself an entirely new kind of creature: a market driven nation-state. It was a system that created new freedoms and opportunities as embodied in the world-infused art of Johannes Vermeer, or the watercolours of the naturalist and illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian. David ends with the transitional story of the British in India: at first the British were as open to foreign influence as the Dutch. But by the 1800s they became more aggressive and the era of encounters gave way to the era of muscular empire, that was dismissive of India's arts and cultures.

Bob Stanley of cult band Saint Etienne explains the significance of this music to generations, surprisingly showing how long-forgotten test card tunes are sampled in huge-selling American hip-hop records.With the advent of commercial television in the UK, ITV rivalled the BBC for airtime and lured viewers in with the new language of advertisements. But these had not yet reached the impact they had seen in the USA, the home of the TV jingle, where a 30-second tune could make or break a brand, as seen in the competing fortunes of Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Flying west to Las Vegas, Neil meets the most successful jingle singer of all time, Linda November, the unseen voice behind thousands of TV spots and countless hours of high-rating television. He sees how short musical phrases known as stings evolved to brand an increasing range of TV channels in the more competitive world of multi-platform television. And finally, Neil hits the studio with maverick brand composers Jingle Punks to record a jingle that sums up the very heart of the series - Neil Brand himself.

From the Song dynasty in China and the Islamic world, through to the Scientific Revolution and the advent of the industrial era, James shows the very different ways in which humans came to both appreciate and understand nature, whilst at the very same time beginning to dominate and control it.With the advent of landscape painting in medieval China, James discovers that these artworks reflect an attitude of harmony and balance with nature that came from a philosophical belief system known as Daoism. We then meet a Zen Buddhist monk Shunmyo Masuno, who is also an internationally renowned garden designer, and learn that Zen gardens are the means to contemplate the unknowable mysteries of nature. James’s story then moves from East Asia to the cultures of the Islamic world. He examines a brightly coloured chameleon painted by Ustad Mansur in 1612 for the Mughal emperor Jahangir - a combination of artistic flair and close observation in which we see the beauty of the natural world closer than ever before.James also explores the story of one of the first European botanical artists, an extraordinary woman called Maria Sibylla Merian. Her 1705 collection of images from her travels in Suriname was a milestone in natural history. We encounter Nirupa Rao, a contemporary Indian botanical artist who is breathing new life into this traditional art form, working in the jungles of the Western Ghats. From the analytical to the romantic, James’s story then moves to the wild and awesome paintings of JMW Turner, before exploring the advent of landscape photography in the American west. The photography of Carleton Watkins played a part in creating the first protected landscape in the world - Yosemite National Park.James reveals the many ways in which art illuminates the extraordinary changes that took place in this millennia-long period. From an East Asian acceptance of the unknowability of nature to the drive to understand, classify and appreciate it, each point of view is an attempt to understand our place in nature.

Two of his most popular novels, The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go, have also enjoyed success as star-studded film adaptations.  In this revealing profile, Ishiguro explores the significance of his early life in Nagasaki and the experience of growing up in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. He shares memories of feeling like the only Japanese boy in the home counties of England in the early 1960s, and how this helped to shape his viewpoint as a writer. As a young man, he harboured ambitions to be a singer-songwriter, and he shares his lifelong emotional connection to music and lyrics, and the impact that particular songs have had on his writing.  Alongside contributions from writers Hanya Yanagihara and Bernardine Evaristo, as well as Ai-Da, an AI robot artist, Ishiguro charts the development of his work across the four decades of his writing career. He discusses the recurring themes of memory, history and the redemptive power of love, and reveals how he has turned his gaze to the future for his much-anticipated new book, Klara and the Sun.

The programme considers her rural upbringing and the influence living and working on a farm that claimed the lives of her father and two brothers has had on her art. Her strength of character and her strong faith have been tested repeatedly since her family was rocked by tragedy in 2012, when her father Noel and brothers Graham and Nevin died in a single, devastating incident on their farm. This programme looks at how Emma has tried to cope with such a traumatic loss and what impact it has had on her art, as well as revealing the family’s story since then. Nevin was well known as a professional rugby player with Ulster, and Emma reflects on how their similar outgoing personalities and careers in the public eye were at odds with the traditions of their close-knit and private rural family. Emma explores how her work conveys the juxtaposition between traditional pastoral landscapes and the realities of farming the land as seen through the eyes of those who live and work on it. She reflects on resilience and surviving loss and considers wider themes such as how grief and trauma can be reflected in and processed through making art.

Arts;Salt, by Selina Thompson;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Salt, by Selina Thompson;Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09z0lbj.jpg;46 mins;2733;9pm 24 Oct 2021;Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.;Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning and deeply personal monologue about her journey by cargo ship, retracing the route of the transatlantic slave trade.;Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning dramatic monologue about a journey she made by cargo ship to retrace the triangular route of the transatlantic slave trade. Poetic and deeply personal, Salt is part testimony, part performance and part excavation of collective memory through archive and music.Throughout the film, Thompson explores her painfully difficult but ultimately redemptive exploration of the Atlantic triangle, and in doing so, takes us on a cathartic pilgrimage through grief, race and identity. Darkly comic in places but also intensely sad, Salt is Thompson’s deeply human response to being both British and a descendant of a people enslaved by the British.Central to Salt is Thompson’s physical performance of her monologue. She plays a character, known simply as The Woman, who pounds great rocks of salt, tells profound stories and makes wry observations. The Woman allows Thompson’s particular journey and personal experience to hold a greater resonance, representing the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The salt the Woman breaks down into manageable pieces embodies that shared experience – the labour of negotiating racism, the tears, the sweat, the healing. The salt is also of the sea, itself a character in the piece that plays witness to the atrocities of the Middle Passage.Complementing Thompson’s performance is a revealing, unflinchingly honest and at times humorous interview conducted by Afua Hirsch.Thompson describes her journey, reflecting on the feelings and thoughts that defined her experience at the time, as well as her meditations now, five years after the original journey. She is an exceptional storyteller and her candidness, vivid powers of description and facility with language give Salt a raw and powerful intimacy. Recalled in distinct chapters, Thompson’s journey takes her by sea from Belgium to Ghana, on to Jamaica and finally back across the Atlantic to Europe. She set out on this extraordinary journey not to try to experience the horror of the Middle Passage, but to ‘sit with it’, to commemorate the dead. Part way through her journey, that grieving process takes on an additional significance with the death of her beloved grandmother. In exploring the past and its lasting legacy, Thompson is also looking for new definitions of home on the three continents she visits, having been told variously her whole life that all of them and none of them were home. Footage of James Baldwin and Stuart Hall, who themselves grappled with this history and its afterlife, speaks to the inspiration and comfort Thompson drew from the black cultural archive and its distinct and rigorous legacy. In Europe, Selina’s place of birth, she examines what it means to be black in a country that must grapple with its leading role in, and lasting benefits from, both slavery and colonialism. Her first sea voyage, where she encounters toxic racism and the abuse of power, becomes a contemporary replica of empire. In Ghana, she explores the complexities of grief and remembrance, and what it means to commemorate a history and a people defined by absence. On her journey between Africa and the Caribbean, she confronts her own privilege and power, granted to her by her British passport.In Jamaica, the country of her grandparents’ birth, she reflects on the nature of diasporic identity, on an island where most people’s ancestors came from somewhere else. On the final leg of her journey, overwhelmed by the weight of history and its ongoing legacy, she reaches a point of crisis, but ultimately, she does find home. Her long journey back into the past allows her, at last, to go forwards, as she closes with the quiet demand that we reckon with the past so that we can all do the same. Salt is a deeply moving account of a young woman grappling with the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The artist in Thompson creates a performance that somehow makes the overwhelming and unsurmountable bearable for her. Steeped in anger but delivered with the lightest of touches, Salt in its essence is about love and family, whether those bonds are biological, chosen through adoption or simply the bonds inherent within the black community. In exposing her pain, and her path towards healing, Thompson lays bare a rare yet vital truth.

She begins with the Romans, heading to the British Museum to discuss a statue of the god Pan having sex with a she-goat, and from there moves through art from the Renaissance to the present day that portrays sex, death, violence and beyond.Mary meets renowned portraitist Daphne Todd as well as contemporary artists Tracey Emin and Martin Creed to discuss works they’ve produced which feature usually private bodily acts or experiences that, for some, have seemed to go too far.

Can the team prove Jon right?;Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould investigate a small oil painting of a man praying in a mosque, a scene filled with meticulously painted and intriguing detail. Its owner, Jon Swihart, bought it at auction in 1999 and believed it to be the work of the nineteenth-century French artist Jean-Leon Gerome, who was a leading figure in the Orientalist genre of painting. When Jon bought the picture, it was listed as 'Circle of Gerome', having been downgraded by the leading authority on the artist at that time, Professor Gerald Ackerman. Previously, however, it had been fully attributed to Gerome, and Jon felt intuitively that it was a genuine work by the artist. Through their shared love of Gerome, Jon and Professor Ackerman had got to know each other and become friends, but Jon bought the picture without consulting him and without knowing that it was Professor Ackerman who had downgraded the picture from a genuine Gerome. It became a sore point between the two of them, and they chose never to discuss the matter again. After Professor Ackerman passed away in 2016, Jon began to wonder again about the authenticity of the picture and got in touch with Fake or Fortune? to see if the team could help. On a video call from his home in Santa Monica, California, Jon reveals to Fiona and Philip that he paid over $6,000 for the painting - a high price for a work considered to be 'circle of'. But as Philip explains, if proven genuine the picture could be worth as much as £100,000.As ever, the team use science and good old-fashioned detective work to get to the truth about this picture. The investigation leads Philip to Barnsley in South Yorkshire, where he sees a promising preparatory sketch for Jon’s picture, but he also comes across a damning letter from Professor Ackerman in the archives that raises the spectre of a faker at work. Meanwhile, Fiona follows the trail of clues in the painting itself and discovers that the historical and cultural inaccuracies common in Orientalist paintings raise more questions than answers. The evidence is gathered, but do they have enough to convince the new Gerome authority that Jon’s instincts were right all along?

Harry Belafonte, Earl Cameron and Diahann Carroll share candid recollections about what it was like to be a pioneer in a white world.;Episode one opens at the Oscars with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde themselves) announcing that Damien Chazelle's beloved musical La La Land had won. However, in perhaps one of the most bizarre and embarrassing moments in the ceremony's 89-year history, amid an onstage melee and calls that there had been a mistake, just like that, Moonlight became the first film with an all-black cast to win Best Picture - a win that is nothing short of historic. Moonlight becomes the first Best Picture winner about black characters that is not about racism and the first about an LGBTQ character. The Oscar-winning Moonlight becomes a symbol for black cinema, a revolutionary moment when black film-makers could identify when diversity and inclusion really started to take over the industry.To try and understand how we got to this moment, the film takes us back on a journey of discovery with three of the most revered and celebrated professionals to have graced the silver screen - Harry Belafonte (91), Earl Cameron (101) and Diahann Carroll (83) - sharing with us honest, candid recollections about what it was like to be a pioneer in a white world. Harry and Earl, share first hand stories about being romantic leads at a time when interracial relationships were banned and the ingenious strategies Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier embarked upon to do to change the status quo. We get to hear them giving their unbridled wisdom, steeped in examples from their long and illustrious careers, as well as from the directors they inspired who have been dubbed the 'rule breakers' who 'ripped up the rule book' to create genre-busting films that have inspired their peers and future generations - Robert Townsend and Spike Lee.Conceptually and visually unique, the series is introduced by the photographer and film-maker Simon Frederick, who guides us through conversations with his illustrious contributors, who reveal their heartfelt stories and unfiltered opinions to paint a unique portrait of how art and activism for black people in film are indivisible from race and cinema.

Almost everyone has good things to say about Turner - after all, he’s responsible for some of Britain’s greatest artistic treasures, like The Fighting Temeraire, and Rain, Steam and Speed. But exactly what makes him great is where opinions can differ.Leslie discovers the TV art historians behind each theory. Was Turner great because he reinvented landscape painting, because he was a radical whose work marked the beginning of modern painting, or because he captured the extraordinary march of the industrial revolution? Through the archives, Leslie meets Fiona Bruce, Simon Schama, Andrew Graham-Dixon and Kenneth Clarke.Leslie also finds that the disputed nature of Turner’s brilliance has made for some entertaining film-making, from a frock-coat- and powdered-wig-loaded reconstruction of his humble origins as the son of a barber in London’s Covent Garden, to modern art historian Tim Marlow lashing himself to a mast in the middle of a choppy ocean to recreate Turner’s inspiration for Fishermen at Sea. Even if you think you know Turner, the programme reveals fascinating surprises about the complex man behind some of Britain’s most revered works of art.

He was the greatest poet of the 18th century and is the second most quoted writer in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations after Shakespeare. Pope stood at just four feet six inches tall. He was a hunchback and an outsider in every way, yet he made the equivalent, in today's money, of one million pounds from his poetry. His satire and wit are all around us, in our everyday speech and songs, yet few are aware of the author and his achievements. Pope’s work is concerned with feminism, friendship, freedom of speech, the environment, corruption in government and what it means to be a moral citizen.

But his work has become so commercialised – used on everything from chocolate boxes to wastepaper bins – that most of us have little sense of how radical an artist he really was.Now, by delving deep in the BBC archives, Katy rediscovers Monet as an artist driven by a burning ambition to relentlessly reinvent his technique and reshape art again and again. Katy learns how Monet set impressionism alight, a movement that shocked and confused the public and critics alike, created his series paintings in an extraordinarily ambitious attempt to capture the nature of time, and would go on to influence America’s mid-century artistic revolutionaries such as Jackson Pollock.The subject of Monet has fascinated many of the BBC’s greatest programme-making talents. We meet Monet portrayed by Richard Armitage as a strapping, young firebrand thumbing his nose at the art establishment in a 2006 costume drama romp, while Andrew Graham-Dixon and Waldemar Januszczak investigate the unexpected and electrifying impact of the modern industrial world on an artist synonymous with pastoral poppy fields and idyllic river scenes. In contrast, Simon Schama opens up Monet’s story with a deep investigation of the dazzling influence of Japanese art on his work, while Robert Hughes takes us on a breathtaking journey through Monet’s extraordinary gardens at Giverny.

Rare archive combines with performances from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.;Scotland has always been intensely proud of its landscape. But at the same time, Scotland has always done its natural world grave harm. As the Cop26 conference on climate change approaches in Glasgow, BBC Scotland’s Changing Landscapes meditates upon the care and carelessness we’ve brought to bear on the environment. In this 60-minute film, Scotland’s film and video archives from the last 100 years illustrate the story of this contradiction. The words of poets, ecologists, journalists and travellers - read by some of Scotland’s most famous voices - are combined with the voices of ordinary folk from our archival store people whose relationship with land and nature is as varied as folk always are. It is their workplace, the place where they take their leisure, the place where they go to shoot the carefully curated stocks of deer and grouse. We see how very deep we have mined and drilled in search of coal and oil – and how far we have hiked and biked in search of solitude and beauty. We learn that the damage done has always been at the back of our minds, at the very least since the 1930s. Driving the film is BBC Scotland’s Scottish Symphony Orchestra performing a carefully selected soundtrack of work by Scottish composers old and new, featuring pieces by one of Scotland’s oldest living composers, Thea Musgrave, and one of its youngest, Jay Capperauld. We hear from some of the finest of Scotland’s folk musicians, Julie Fowlis and Kris Drever, who remind us that Scotland’s relationship with nature has been in many ways like a bad romance. Our narrators read passages from a wide range of sources. We hear words from Scotland’s newly appointed makar, Kathleen Jamie, and passages from poets such as Edwin Muir, Liz Lochhead, Edwin Morgan, Magi Gibson, Don Paterson and Robert Burns – evocations of Scotland’s landscapes, both rural and urban. We also hear from travel writers and journalists, old biographies of Osgood Mackenzie and excerpts of the ecologist Fraser Darling’s 1930s report on the Scottish Highlands: ‘they are a wet desert'. Readings from newspapers, accounts of mining, environmental protests, good summers, hard winters, trespassing ramblers seeking the right to roam. And growing towns. Changing Landscapes, sometimes abstract in places, evokes a Scotland – and a planet - which may be on the brink of environmental collapse.

Van Gogh was 37 when he shot himself, but in the four years before he died, he painted some of the world’s most beloved works, using colour in ways that changed art forever.In this programme, Kate discovers that film-makers have found it impossible to separate Van Gogh's work from his life – from his fraught relationship with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, to the heartbreaking struggle with his mental health that ended in tragedy. In their efforts to understand Van Gogh’s complex psyche, and where his talent and extraordinary feeling for colour came from, programme makers have explored the French countryside, where his most famous works were painted, set off on detective trails to solve the mystery of his severed ear, and delved into his personal letters, casting some of the world's most remarkable actors – from Benedict Cumberbatch to Kirk Douglas – to bring his words and work to life.

Charting the spectacular rise, fall and comeback story of era-defining star and Generation X icon Winona Ryder, from Heathers and Beetlejuice to Black Swan and Stranger Things. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Winona Ryder appeared in several acclaimed and zeitgeist-grabbing films, including Edward Scissorhands, Little Women and Reality Bites, but being so closely associated with a specific cultural moment made it hard for her to stay in the spotlight into the 2000s. However, this has proved to be a blessing as well as a curse, as a wave of nostalgia for the 1980s has since brought Winona back onto our screens where she rightly belongs, introducing a whole new generation to her unique talents.

Simon discovers that landscape painting is seldom a straightforward description of observed nature.;Simon Schama explores one of our deepest artistic urges - the depiction of nature. Simon discovers that landscape painting is seldom a straightforward description of observed nature - rather it is a projection of dreams and idylls, as well as of escapes and refuges from human turmoil, the elusive paradise on earth.Simon begins in the 10th century, in Song dynasty China. The Song's scrolls are never innocent of the values of that world - the landscapes depict immense mountains projecting imperial authority. But as that authority was threatened and overwhelmed, majestic mountains are represented in geological turmoil, writhing and heaving. Imagined paradises in Islamic and western art are often responses to loss and absence. But paradise could be recovered in the country villas of the Renaissance.Simon goes to the beautiful Palladian house of Daniele Barbaro in the Veneto, with murals painted by Paolo Veronese to contemplate the world of the cultivated country gentleman. It was in the cooler climate of northern Europe that landscape came into its own as a distinctive type of art. Simon explores the works of the northern Renaissance in Germany and the Netherlands, where emerging states sought expression of identity through depiction of their natural worlds. Simon ends in America, where the landscapes of America are as expansive as the landscapes of Holland were confined, but there too, in the numinous photography of Ansel Adams, a kind of earthly paradise is revealed and a sense of nationhood is expressed in the natural world.

How, and at what cost, do different religions make the unseen visible?;Professor Mary Beard broaches the controversial, sometimes dangerous, topic of religion and art. For millennia, art has inspired religion as much as religion has inspired art. Yet there are fundamental problems, which all religions share, in making the divine visible in the human world. How, and at what cost, do you make the unseen seen? Beneath all works of religious art there always lies conflict and risk. The result is often iconoclasm - the destruction of works of art - which Mary believes can lead on to new forms of creativity.Mary visits sacred sites across the world to examine the contested boundaries between religion and art. She goes to the temple of Angkor Wat, the Tintoretto Crucifixion in Venice, the Buddhist caves of Ajanta and the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, as she seeks to break down the conventions that centre some religions around images, while others are seen as hostile to artistic representation. She shows how all faiths (and their artists) face the same fundamental problems of treading a careful line between glorifying gods in images and blaspheming by daring to represent the divine.She ends at the Parthenon in Athens, a building that has been in turn a pagan temple, a Christian church and a mosque. Now, as a monument to Western civilisation itself and a tourist pilgrimage site, she asks us to wonder what we now worship - how far we look at civilisation itself with 'the eye of faith'.

These rare works have been in the V&A’s stores for 150 years, but before they can go on display for the first time, each King of Purgatory must undergo extensive conservation. Susan has already worked on two of the kings, having learnt from a master craftsman at Nanjing Museum how to conserve them using traditional Chinese techniques. Now she is deploying her new-found skills in conserving king number eight, which will involve dousing the watercolour and ink paintings with very hot water and applying new lining paper made with yasha, a traditional Japanese dye created from cones of the alder tree. It is not a process for the faint-hearted, and as Susan manoeuvres almost two metres of soggy painting on to a special upright board to dry, there is a chance that the delicate paper may tear. Meanwhile, the Theatre and Performance department has just acquired one of the favourite outfits of legendary pop diva Dame Shirley Bassey. Curator Simon is keen to get the spectacular skin-tight catsuit on display, but the costume, encrusted with sequins, crystals and beads, needs some serious conservation first. Made in 1969 by British couturier Douglas Darnell, the body-hugging sheer silk chiffon outfit was worn by Shirley Bassey on and off for 30 years first on the album cover of her famous Bond title song Diamonds are Forever, then through a number of stage performances, culminating in her 60th birthday concert. Getting it ready for display will take hours of careful stitching, with specially adapted needles and sheer threads kept in perfect tension, to ensure it is ready for its new starring role. Finally, the glittering catsuit is dressed on a specially made fibreglass Bassey mannequin. Here it can be reunited with a gold lame cape trimmed with turquoise-blue ostrich feathers, made to accompany the outfit, before its debut in the gallery.Over in the cafe area, a major refit provides an opportunity for a flamboyant Victorian majolica vase, dedicated to the god of wine Bacchus, to shine for the first time. The colourful vase, decorated with goat-like satyrs sticking their tongues out, was made in 1883 by the innovative Minton factory in Staffordshire. Minton also decorated the museum’s Gamble Room, part of the world’s first-ever museum cafe.  Minton became one of the most important ceramics manufacturers of the Victorian era after developing a new technology that could produce majolica, a type of colourful ceramic, by firing many-coloured glazes all at once at low temperatures. When Queen Victoria ordered some of Minton’s majolica for Buckingham Palace, the colourful objects became the must-have decor of the Victorian era. But the Minton vase must undergo a deep clean before it is ready to take its place in the newly refurbished cafe.The museum collects objects both old and new. Over in the sculpture department a new acquisition by contemporary sculptor Eleanor Lakelin, Echoes of Amphora, is joining the collection. Eleanor’s unusual sculpture looks like it is made from clay or pottery but is in fact carved from an ancient tree that had to be cut down. Using furniture-making techniques, Eleanor turns the wood on a lathe to create a huge vessel that she then scorches to reveal the burrs or scars of the ancient tree in all its beauty. When she visits the V&A to see her finished work on show, alongside the museum’s most celebrated sculptures in the Cast Courts, it is an honour that most artists can only dream of.

It is an autobiographical exploration of the value of family life in the face of the gathering storm that became the Troubles - one which led to him leaving the city. Sir Kenneth became a household name while still in his 20s for his acclaimed work as an actor and director who breathed new life into the plays of Shakespeare.

He also discusses his own childhood experiences of being caught up in rioting as both bystander and participant, his parents’ zest for life and how leaving the city left a deep mark on him.

But in the 15th and 16th centuries, the great Islamic empires experienced their own extraordinary cultural flowering. The two phenomena did not unfold in separate artistic universes - they were acutely conscious of, and in competition with, each other and mutually open to influences flowing both ways. The fifth film in Civilisations goes east and west with Simon Schama - to Papal Rome, but also to Ottoman Istanbul and Mughal Lahore and Agra, exploring those connections and rivalries, and examining how the role of artists from the different traditions of west and east developed in the years that followed the Renaissances.That rivalry unfolds most spectacularly over the creation of domes - in Ottoman Istanbul the great engineer-architect Mimar Sinan builds the light-flooded Suleymaniye Mosque, while at the same time in Rome, Michelangelo designed the great dome over the St Peter's Basilica. The fate of the hero-artist, seemingly touched by God, with the gift of making visual miracles, henceforth diverged in the east and west. In Europe, as the century turned, artists such as Benvenuto Cellini, with his sculpture of Perseus with the Head of Medusa, could lay claim to sovereignty over the world of art. The greatest European artists like Caravaggio, Velasquez and Rembrandt shook off decorum and turned muscular, earthy and theatrical. Meanwhile in the east, Mughal art, still capable of acts of breathtaking architectural and painterly beauty, as expressed in mausoleums like the I'timad-ud-Daulah and gorgeous miniature paintings, became ever more refined, poetic and exquisite.

The Met is open, but in a safe and very limited way. Visitor income helps keep the museum running, so times are hard. Since it was founded, like so many US arts institutions, the Metropolitan has largely been funded by benefactors. We visit Clyde B Jones III, the executive matching modern donors to exhibitions and events as the economy tanks. Jones explains how hard it is to keep up the social links that the system depends on. He has, nonetheless, found it possible to drum up millions of dollars for the imminent remodelling of the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas galleries. Currently, the need to shade the massive south-facing glass wall that illuminates the rooms means artefacts are not shown to their best advantage. Now he must find the funds to replace those walls. Some give money, but others donate items from their own collections. We meet curator Jaysen Dobney of the musical instruments department as a rock musician and long-term patron asks for help with his problem, a collection of 403 guitars. Dobney is only too happy to have a promised gift of a 60s Gibson Les Paul TV Special.Every department is currently calling on its supporters. In Textile Conservation, Head Curator Janina Poskrobko makes breakfast for a visiting professor. We've been with her since dawn, at home in Staten island, saying her prayers. She must find the money for an unfunded project - the rescue of an Ottoman robe. We observe as she subtly raises the issue while showing him a Renaissance cape. The professor is a textile expert and passionate supporter. Might he dig deep?The Costume Institute is normally funded by stars who pay to attend the famous Met Gala fashion event, but this year they're economising. The 2020 Ball is cancelled, so 2019's proceeds must be used carefully. We follow the building of About Time as the set undergoes construction and the garments are installed. Meanwhile, fashionable friends are stepping up. In Detroit, America's most flamboyant private collector of couture, Sandy Shrier, opens her home, and her heart, to explain why the Met is so important to her - and why last year she donated 160 garments amassed over seven decades of collecting.In London, we are with top-end cobbler Georgina Goodman, who has just taken a call from the Met, asking for help bolstering their huge accessories archive. In the mid-2000s, Goodman attracted the attention of couturier Alexander McQueen. Packing up her sketches, the designer reveals how she was charged with interpreting Lee McQueen's footwear visions, including the iconic armadillo shoe. The Met has a pair, but is keen to acquire Goodman's original sketches.   As Covid keeps visitor numbers low, every ticket purchased helps keep the lights on and the building open. With no tourist trade, the Met is back to where it began in 1870, catering for locals. Citizens are not obliged to pay for entry into the museum, but Naqiya Hussein has bought two tickets. She's joining the many young people, newly unlocked but making only tentative outings, on a Met Date. Her scientist beau Cyril and she enjoy the tranquillity of solitude in her favourite galleries, though the camera is ever present. A date here is a litmus test of love. If the million objects on display can't spark a conversation, it's never going to work.Perhaps the greatest donation is a lifetime of work at the Met - or the possibility at least. We are with Vietnamese-American student Kevin Pham as he visits the medieval department at the Met Cloisters in northern Manhattan. He's one of 120 postgraduate interns, paid through a new $5M donation to study with a view to a possible career in the museum. The Met wants to build a new and diverse staff, and must succeed if it is to remain relevant. As Kevin says, the museum can't be the preserve of bearded old white men. At Halloween, About Time opens. The annual Costume Institute show is always a blockbuster that draws in the crowds, and now the stakes are high. The newly reopened Met must show that it is still the place for fashion as art. This anniversary year, a mirrored gallery, packed with black garments from across 150 years, points to objects that are timeless in an industry now driven by constant change. We're with fashionistas as they thrill to the show, noting that even on a budget, Curator Andrew Bolton has managed to make a splash. Philanthropy has always kept the Met alive and vibrant, and as the nights draw in, there's disquiet about the upcoming US election and its effect on giving. A change of administration, or the return of President Trump, might warp the delicate web of tax breaks and write-offs that underpin the whole arts world. With the fall-out of Covid and the tumult of Black Lives Matter in mind, CEO Dan Weiss gives a dark assessment of America's contribution to history. And on the night of the election itself, Head of Communications Ken Weine worries about money, staff and the fate of culture itself.

Six talented amateur photographers have made it through a nationwide call-out to be selected for the opportunity of a lifetime. With top photographer and film-maker Rankin as their guide and mentor, this is a unique masterclass and a chance to show they have what it takes to stand out as a new name in British photography.Across a month of assignments and feedback, they will tackle 12 very different challenges that showcase and stretch their skill and creativity. Every shot counts as they build up to the final task of creating a brand new portfolio of their work. Who will shine as they compete for the chance to be crowned the winner of the Great British Photography Challenge?In this first episode of the series, the amateurs meet Rankin for the first time and share their homework assignment with him and the audience. We kick off the challenges faced in this episode in Brighton, with a speed assignment that uses nothing more than a smartphone. How will they fare when limited to the use of basic equipment? Also featured in this episode is a nature assignment with Chris Packham, who tasks the photographers with finding and presenting him with a stand-out image from his own backyard in the New Forest. And we see the contestants thrown in at the deep end with a brief to capture a celebrity portrait, tasked with taking a magazine cover photo of renowned actor and Rankin’s good friend Anna Friel.Across the series, we’ll see the six photographers spending several weeks on the road, tackling various assignments around the country. All of them go through the entire experience and the series delivers multiple perspectives on each task. Guest experts are on hand to offer coaching in the field, and the first challenge featured in each episode always sees the photographers put on the spot to take a picture that will impress Rankin in just one hour, using only their smartphone cameras. Returning to the classroom from their travels, there’s group feedback on their shots, and the pressure is on to select and edit, from among the hundreds of images they’ve taken, a final portfolio that they believe shows their individual flair and way of seeing the world around them.At the end of the series, it’s time to plan and mount the exhibitions of their final portfolios. Who will show Rankin and fellow judges from the art and fashion world they have what it takes to take home the title of winner of the Great British Photography Challenge?

Blending discourse with mythology, interview with autobiography, geomancy with geopolitics, the intimate and the celestial, this explosive collage is a retort to our troubled moment of multiple crises. Spanning performance, animation, interviews (including with artist Bob and Roberta Smith), text and original music composition, the 14-minute video-essay is a whirlwind of eight exercises for the body and mind.  Playful yet poignant, coy yet in-your-face, poetic yet pungent, it argues that in such times of despair, art can remind us to imagine how things can be, and that each of us must play an active part. Drawing on the words of Lorde, Bretch, Beckett, Abdelkader Benali and more, it calls on viewers to (re-)imagine, and act on, how things can become. The film builds on the director’s efforts since the pandemic, which are advancing conversations around creativity and neurodiversity, and the socio-political role of ‘artfulness’.Be prepared to be disorientated, surprised, provoked, and re-energised.

How the music of Mendelssohn embodies the Victorian age, and how he pioneered the conductor's baton.;Conductor Charles Hazlewood explores the lives, times and music of great composers. In the final programme in the series, he looks at Mendelssohn, whose music embodies the sound of the Victorian age. A friend of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Mendelssohn made ten visits to Britain and his work appealed strongly to British tastes. Mendelssohn's melodies such as O for the Wings of a Dove and Hark! the Herald Angels Sing became hugely popular and his astonishing overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream perfectly captured the Victorians' fondness for Shakespeare and fairy stories. He portrayed the grandeur of Scotland through a romanticism shared with poets such as Keats and Wordsworth, and captured the public imagination with his pioneering use of a new conductor's tool - the baton. Charles's journey includes a stormy boat trip to Fingal's Cave and a visit to a chocolate factory, as well as a trip to the recently restored Birmingham Town Hall, where a massed choir comprising choral groups from across the West Midlands is brought together with the BBC Concert Orchestra and soloist Andrew Shore to perform extracts from Mendelssohn's iconic work Elijah.

From the art of prehistoric hunters and the advent of agriculture and our first cities to the arrival the great faiths, including Hinduism and Christianity, James shows how we began to wrestle with our place in nature and tried to control the great forces that shape our world. Along the way, we journey from Arctic Norway to the jungles of Guatemala and the holy city of Varanasi in India.Beginning with cave paintings of animals and a fascinating 12,000-year-old carving of a reindeer, James shows how we were once much closer to nature. We meet Nils Peder, a contemporary Sami Reindeer Herder in northern Norway. His way of life is still influenced by a belief in nature’s spiritual energy and power. But then as James studies an ancient Egyptian model of cattle, we reach a dramatic turning point in our relationship with nature - the advent of agriculture. At this point, humans collaborated with nature but ultimately took ‘control’. James takes this a step further with the extraordinary lion hunt carvings from the Assyrian palace of Nineveh. He demonstrates how it was at this time that humans began to set out to conquer nature. James then turns his attention to ways in which religion helped us make sense of the great shifts in our relationship with nature. We see the first human personifications of natural forces: the river Ganga in India and the ancient Greek god of the sky, Zeus. And we see how, in Christian art, nature becomes the backdrop for the very human-focused story of the crucifixion.In this first great phase in human history, James reveals how we moved from caves to farms, to the emergence of the first civilisations and to global faiths. And through it all, he shows how we struggled to control nature and began to move away from it, no longer living as just one part of the natural world.

Then in May 2020, the murder of George Floyd, only the latest in a litany of killings of African Americans by white police officers, forces America to confront, once again, inequalities in social justice. At the museum, the executive are examining their historical record on inclusion, exclusion and diversity, in art and staffing, and find it wanting. In an open letter, questions have been raised and accusations levelled about systemic racism at all New York arts institutions. CEO Dan Weiss has been wrong-footed by anger from within the museum about a postcolonial state of mind expressed in some of the Met's most treasured objects. In the American Wing, Weiss ponders a 21st-century question: some of the art reflects 19th-century tastes and attitudes to other cultures, in particular the First Nations, who were moved off their homelands even as the museum was being built. It's not just indigenous peoples most citizens of New York are not Caucasian - where are their stories? How do black and brown visitors feel about their representation in an art house that says it wants to be all things to all people? The programme moves on with a chronicle of a visit to the Met by Connecticut resident and mum of two Tracy-Ann Samuel. The African American community worker grew up in the city. For her and husband Cleon the Met was more than a museum it was a portal to other cultures, ideas and, of course, beauty. She wants her girls, Kristen, ten, and Kelsie, four, to see positive depictions of people who look like them, and to ask questions about art that makes statements and assumptions about gender, power and race.The theme of art and politics as indivisible begins. The Samuel family analyses the messaging in one of the Met's keystone treasures, Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. It's a celebrated depiction of heroism, idealising a pivotal moment in the struggle to create the republic, which forms part of the national narrative displayed in the American Wing. Kristen Samuel is a dispassionate viewer, but finds little to interest her.In contrast, Wooden Boat People, two works by Cree artist Kent Monkman, speak directly to the family. Provocatively positioned in the Great Hall, the paintings were commissioned by the Met, who invited Monkman to look for inspiration in the collections. Leutze's Washington portrait was his choice. The works feature Monkman's gender-fluid alter ego, Miss Chief Testickle.We see the Canadian artist in his rural studio near Toronto to hear of his relationship with the Met, colonial attitudes and the activities of the slave-owning, native-baiting Washington.At the museum, there's more political comment, long hidden but now revealed by x-ray analysis of Jacques-Louis David's portrait of scientists Mr and Mrs Lavoisier. Painted just before the French Revolution, it had depicted the bourgeois couple as clever but chic, but was hurriedly overpainted to save them from the guillotine.But should stories of the old, white and dead take precedence in the museum? And should it concern itself with anything more than the beauty of the exhibits? These issues are discussed by Head of Modern and Contemporary Art Sheena Wagstaff, who proactively promotes the work of African American and other unrepresented artists. She's just added Rashid Johnson's Five Broken Men to the collection. The issue, says Mary Rockefeller, whose family have long been Met donors, is respect. Her father Nelson was so obsessed with what was once called ‘Primitive Art’ that he gave the Met his personal collection and then built a vast wing to house it. Named for Mary's twin David, who disappeared in Papua New Guinea, the collection of arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas is the setting for the existential question facing all museums: shouldn't the exhibits be given back?Puerto Rican artist Miguel Luciano has taken the discussion a step forward by 3D modelling a 1,000-year-old wooden devotional statue from the Rockefeller collection. He's not for taking it back, but for re-contextualising an object designed to be handled. We are with him as he unveils it to veteran social photographer Hiram Maristany. Luciano is working on a Met programme that aims to use artefacts to build links with communities who might feel that the museum, and its collections, have little to say to them.At the end of their visit, the Samuel family find that the season's stand-out exhibition, The American Struggle, speaks volumes to them. Thirty panels by Jacob Lawrence, leading African American painter of the postwar period, celebrate the contribution of black citizens to the birth of the nation. Tracy-Ann sees the Met has a long way to go, but the journey to greater diversity, fairer representation and visibility has begun.

Initially he wonders if the work might be by mannerist painter Parmigianino, but once the restoration is underway, and after examining other works by the Renaissance master, he is forced to abandon this idea and start again.Emma explores the story of the man who bought the portrait, Wilbraham, the first Earl Egerton of Tatton, whose social climbing saw him turn the mansion into a marvel of luxury and won him an aristocratic title.

This new lead prompts a trip to Rome and Florence, which finally confirms an attribution for the painting and ultimately reveals the subject to be a well-known Renaissance anatomist. This prompts Emma to investigate the symbiotic relationship between art and anatomy.

At 78 feet in height, the famous Great East Window at York Minster is the largest medieval stained-glass window in the country and the creative vision of a single artist, a mysterious master craftsman called John Thornton, one of the earliest named English artists.The Great East Window has been called England's Sistine Chapel. Within its 311 stained-glass panels is the entire history of the world, from the first day to the Last Judgment, and yet it was made 100 years before Michelangelo's own masterpiece. The scale of Thornton's achievement is revealed as Dr Ramirez follows the work of a highly skilled conservation team at York Glaziers Trust. They dismantled the entire window as part of a five-year project to repair centuries of damage and restore it to its original glory. It is a unique opportunity for Dr Ramirez to examine Thornton's greatest work at close quarters, to discover details that would normally be impossible to see and to reveal exactly how medieval artists made images of such delicacy and complexity using the simplest of tools.The Great East Window of York Minster is far more than a work of artistic genius, it is a window into the medieval world and mind, telling us who we once were and who we still are, all preserved in the most fragile medium of all.

Guided by Bobo, a local of Berber descent, Rom discovers a place that is vast and inhospitable - at once impossibly bleak and impossibly beautiful.;A year ago, Romesh Ranganathan visited the Arctic to film a Christmas episode of the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan. It was the hardest trip he has taken in his life – it was minus 40 degrees, he had to camp in a tent on a frozen ocean and he had to go to the toilet in a bin bag. This year, he has agreed to do another Christmas episode - on the strict understanding that he will not go anywhere cold.And so Rom is travelling to the Sahara Desert.Owing to the tradition of shooting Christmas episodes in July, he has arrived at the hottest time of the year – over the next week temperatures will rise to 50 degrees Celsius. An inescapable wall of heat beats down from above, rises up from the sand below and makes everyone massively narky.  Guided by Bobo, a local of Berber descent who was born and grew up in the desert, Rom discovers a place that is vast and inhospitable - at once impossibly bleak and impossibly beautiful.His journey takes him from Marrakesh in Morocco all the way through the Sahara to the ocean in Western Sahara, 700 miles further south. Along the way, he takes in hot air balloon rides and obscure villages where they make world-famous pottery, and he learns how to treat your arm if you get bitten by a snake (cut open a dog and stick your arm inside its dying carcass). Rom meets nomads who have learned to survive in the middle of the desert, endures sand storms, hears about the largely forgotten war fought for control of Western Sahara and discovers why indigenous people are abandoning the desert in record numbers. Epic, informative and ever so slightly silly, Romesh’s misadventures in the Sahara shine a light on one of the most overlit places on earth.

They would catch the train from north London to fish this network of rivers and canals that flow from Hertfordshire into the Thames, and just like when Paul was young, Paul and Bob fish for perch.They start their trip in a quiet and secluded stretch of the Lea. Paul gives Bob a copy of The Compleat Angler by Izaak Walton, a 17th-century fishing guide that was written here in Hertfordshire on the Lea and takes the form of a conversation between a skilled angler and his apprentice. Drawing the obvious comparisons, Bob delves into the book over the course of the trip to see if any of its contents still ring true today. They agree they need to be stealthy on this stretch of river, and in hushed tones they chose a suitable spot and settle in. The whispered conversation turns to their teenage years, and they discuss their memories of school dinners, bands they were in and making friends. Bob has prepared Paul a riverside picnic inspired by his trips here when he was young – jam and banana sandwiches and crisps - bringing them both a Proustian rush of teenage, packed-lunch nostalgia. For this episode, Paul has invited a special guest along to the river – Feargal Sharkey, former lead singer of The Undertones turned angler and river conservationist, who fishes the River Lea regularly. As well as discussing their love of fishing, Paul reveals an amusing connection he has to Feargal, which could have seen his life turn out quite differently.   Bob reveals their home for this trip will be a narrowboat, nestled in a quiet section of the canal, close to where they will fish the next day. Over a drink at the end of the day, Paul shares some teenage photos of him and his friends - Bob finds the 1970s hairstyles particularly unusual.On their second day on the River Lea, they return to one of Paul’s favourite haunts – a weir pool that hasn’t much changed since he used to visit, and still home to roach and dace. As they fish, they compare being a teen in the 70s to now, and how ambitions change over time. Bob reads from The Compleat Angler, choosing a section to reveal his gratitude to Paul.They return to the houseboat that evening, and Bob is cooking another 1970s-inspired dish – corned beef and potato pie, just like Paul’s mum used to make. To their surprise, they find it rather tasty after a day out fishing. To round off the trip, Bob performs a song he has written all about what they got up to during their two days on the Lea.

Then there’s the British vampire Laszlo – a bit of a rogue and a dandy and a fop, he might say. He’s a lover of mischief and a great soiree, but not as much as he loves seeing Nandor fail miserably in every attempt. And then there’s Nadja: the seductress, the temptress, the vampiric Bonnie to Laszlo’s Clyde. Her wisdom and provocative tales from times past allow us insight into the many ups and downs of living an immortal life.Also cohabiting in the vampire household is Guillermo, Nandor’s familiar aka servant/protector during the daylight hours, who wants nothing more than to be made a real vampire just like his master. Also lurking about is Colin Robinson, an energy vampire and day-walker of sorts – he feasts on humans but not on their blood. A frequent visitor is Nadja’s new friend Jenna, a student at a nearby community college. She loves LARPing, boys and art history, and for some reason has been rather confused lately as to why it is she so ravenously craves the flesh of the living.After an unexpected visit from their dark lord and leader, Baron Afanas, the vampires are reminded of what they were initially tasked with upon their arrival in Staten Island over 100 years ago – total and complete domination of the New World. But what exactly is the best way to go about achieving said domination? Our camera crew follows along as the vampires set out to answer this query.

From a brief glance at an atlas, Albania has everything - beaches on the same coastline as Greece and Croatia, hills to trek in and stunning mountains. But for some reason all the average Brit knows about Albania is the old black and white clips from the communist era - and most of those have been mistaken for clips shot in Moscow.On arrival, Romesh does indeed discover a country that is bleak and miserable, but then again it is raining, and even his native Crawley seems a bit lacklustre in the rain. Guided by local TV presenter and journalist Erjona Rusi, Romesh is taken on a whistle-stop tour of the country. He visits the beaches (apparently stunning in the summer, but when Ramesh arrives it is -10 degrees) and is hosted on a unique homestay in a beautiful isolated shepherd's village, where he is sent out on overnight wolf patrol and then embarks on a treacherous seven-hour journey into the mountains.Along the way, Romesh tries to discover why Albania has remained a stubbornly unfashionable holiday destination, while many other formerly communist nations have leapt ahead. Romesh meets those at the extremes of this unique country, from the rural farmers to the billionaire playboys who live in the cities next to supermodels. He ends up with sheep poo mysteriously smeared across his back and, in a move he will doubtless come to regret, a tattoo emblazoned across his forearm. He finds a people desperate to throw off their reputation as the home of eastern mafia gangs, lots of Raki and a level of hospitality that he describes as 'second to none' as he gets an insider's guide to Albania.

In a flash they disappear and then he has to deal with the real world: work, family, money, trying to be a good dad, husband and neighbour. Dog poo features pretty heavily in this episode. Herbert's shoes watch him wallop their mate against a wall. Jonny wallop does an impression of his dog.

Famous for its gin-clear water, the Test is renowned as the home of fly-fishing. Paul and Bob are here during the mayfly hatch – the peak of the trout fishing season. Before they start to fish, Paul shows Bob how to tie a fly – a technique that was refined and developed here on the Test in the 19th century. Paul also has a Victorian rod to use today. Their quarry is brown trout – another fish which has eluded Bob up until now.As they fish, they mull over what is might be like to be a mayfly, having just one day to live after they hatch. They ponder what they would do if they just had 24 hours left and are surprised to find they have a lot they want to fit in. As the sun starts to set, Bob prepares a riverside picnic for them, and all too soon it is time to leave the river and see what Bob has chosen for their accommodation. This week it is a treehouse, set within fields and rolling farmland. Bob creates his own version of a pub here in the treehouse, with him as the landlord, and over a pint they take stock of the day.The next morning, Paul gets to the river early and starts fishing, but Bob takes a detour to a local plant nursery to buy Paul a gift. They meet up on the river and as they get fishing, the conversation turns to the fleeting nature of life, their attitudes to death and a realisation of things to be thankful for. They end another glorious day’s fishing with a very special bankside picnic, and this time Bob has a few belated birthday treats in store for Paul.

Last time they were here, they fished the Middle Wye for barbel, but this time they head to the spectacular Lower Wye to fish for chub. Bob has decided to meet Paul at the river and makes his entrance from upstream – on a rowing boat. Any annoyance Paul has at Bob disturbing his rod and the fish is soon replaced with amusement as he witnesses Bob trying to exit the boat. They talk tactics, and Bob is pleased to hear that almost anything goes when it comes to suitable bait for the chub. They start to fish, but Bob is distracted by the beautiful views. They discuss the times they have got emotional, the last time they cried and whether it is better to live in the moment or reminisce about past times. Bob tells Paul that he has invited a doctor to come and talk to them about men’s health. They discuss what they might want to ask him and agree the conversation will probably end up being about matters ‘downstairs’. With thunder and lightning looming, they decide to call it a day and take refuge in their accommodation for the night – a converted dovecote situated in the idyllic grounds of a 700-year-old manor house.The next day, Paul and Bob return to the river. The rainclouds have passed, but the river is high and fast. Paul gillies for Bob, and as they wait for something to bite, they talk about self-diagnosis and hypochondria in anticipation of meeting the doctor. Dr Anand Patel arrives at the riverbank, and Paul and Bob discuss with him the health issues that most affect men at their stage of life. They touch on physical but also mental health issues and recall the reasons they started fishing together in the first place – Bob’s sudden heart operation and the effect it had on him in the following months. They fish some more as the afternoon passes, and Bob carries out his final catering duties of the series – he boils the Kelly Kettle and makes some tea, which Paul refuses to drink thanks to its grey tinge and the addition of a twig floating on top. But they both know there is more to being here than drinking tea – and as Paul settles in for a last spot of fishing, it is time for Bob to get in his boat again. As he floats away downriver, we leave Paul and Bob doing what makes them happy, in a place that fills their hearts with joy. Surely, that is the best medicine.

After their agonising last-ditch attempt to catch a salmon on the River Tay in series two, this time around, Paul is determined to fulfil his promise to help Bob get his first salmon – a rite of passage for any angler. They start their search for a so-called bar of silver surrounded by banks of lush tall trees at the Bemersyde Estate, a place where it is easy to forget the outside world and do nothing but concentrate on fishing. Paul is intent on catching, and Bob is hopeful that his angling skills have improved since last time, but whether this is enough for them to hook a salmon is anyone’s guess. After a night in some beautifully renovated, traditional roulottes, rounded off with a campfire supper cooked by Bob, the next morning Paul gets some mystical predictions from a familiar character. They try a different beat on this day and visit the Bridge Pool at Kelso, arguably the most renowned salmon-fishing beat in Scotland. Today, they try boat fishing again, and the memory of the last time they were in Scotland fishing in a boat together spurs them on to try to not just hook but also land a salmon this time.  As Paul and Bob fish, the conversation takes a familiar yet comforting form. Punctuated with both laughter and moments of reflection, they exchange memories of their past lives and thoughts on their present and future selves. They discuss the things that they are grateful for, as well as thinking about what else they want to achieve. Is this the trip where Bob finally ticks ‘catch a salmon’ off his bucket list?

They netted a decent-sized pike in Northern Ireland, but there are bigger and better still to be caught.Fishing for pike means they are lakeside for this episode, under the big skies of East Anglia. As they arrive and get their gear together, Bob introduces Paul to the surprisingly varied contents of his car boot, much to Paul’s amusement. They gather their equipment and find a decent spot that should give them plenty of chances to catch and make camp for the day.They cast out and then settle in to sit and wait for the pike to bite. They are a fearsome fish, the apex predator of the lake, and coming face to face with a giant pike is not for the faint-hearted, which leads Paul and Bob to ruminate on what keeps them up at night and how the things they worry about change as they get older. For lunch, Bob has decided against his usual style of cooking and presents Paul with some army ration packs - contents unknown. Bob simply adds hot water, leaves them to heat up and then serves. Paul gamely gives it a go, but whether the meal is successful enough to become a permanent fixture is anyone’s guess. Bob has chosen a suitably quirky place to stay - a cosy little house converted from an old public toilet block, right on the seafront on the north Norfolk coast. The weather is wild and dramatic, and in the morning before they go fishing, Paul and Bob have a running race on the beach, battling against the wind and rain. They then resume their quest for monster pike, with conversation turning to the challenges in life that still lie ahead. They end their trip with a visit to a local pub, where Bob reveals a hidden trick.

A relative of the goldfish, they have been likened to trying to catch a unicorn. Paul and Bob need to employ every ounce of stealth they can muster, but will it be enough to net a crucian?As the sun breaks through, Paul and Bob have plenty of time to chat as they sit quietly and wait for a bite. The conversation turns to the fact that female fish generally grow bigger than males, which leads Bob to recall his fear and shyness in talking to girls when he was young. They compare chat-up lines and laugh at how awkward they used to be, as well as thinking about the most important women in their lives and how those relationships shaped them. They discuss how different the images of male and female pop stars are today – and how it seems that it is easier now for men to sing about emotions and heartache. As Paul moves to another section of the lake, Bob starts to prepare their bankside breakfast. He is cooking them a healthy vegetarian option, but when it is time for Paul to stop fishing and come and eat, he is distracted by a new addition to their lakeside scene. Bob has brought a new fishing chair that Paul finds distressing to the eye - and he lets Bob know as much. Later in the day, Bob gets Paul back for his outburst. As it approaches midday, Paul and Bob know that the best of the day’s fishing is behind them, and they pack up and drive to their accommodation for the night – an old converted chapel set in lush green surroundings. Before they go inside, they take a walk around the deconsecrated graveyard outside the chapel. That evening, Bob has a fun night in planned – drinks, nibbles and a bit of pampering - but first he wants Paul to show he is truly sorry for the earlier business with Bob’s new chair. After they have made amends, Paul is inspired to write a heartfelt song in the style of today’s male singer-songwriters. He shares with Bob what he has come up with so far. The next morning, they return to the lakes, and a change in the weather brings a different set of challenges and ways to approach catching a crucian carp. Again, they fish both together and apart, but always in earshot of one another so they can witness any catching action as it unfolds. Bob rounds off the day with a vegetarian curry. He also makes a campfire, and as they sit next to it and eat, Paul shares the latest version of his song, which is entitled Not Good Enough. Bob soon joins in – it is too catchy not to.

After this disappointment, a renaissance began with the aim of rebuilding the nation’s sporting prowess. Kickstarted by Conservative prime minister John Major, the project flushed Britain’s sporting system with millions of pounds from the new National Lottery. Athletes would give up their day jobs and be paid to become full-time sportsmen and women, the world's best coaches would be hired and state-of-the-art scientific techniques employed, all in the hope that Team GB would start winning medals at the Sydney games in 2000. With the world-beating American, Russian, German and Chinese teams in their sights, it was a tough task. Told through the eyes of national heroes including Dame Kelly Holmes, Linford Christie, Darren Campbell, Jonathan Edwards and Sir Chris Hoy, the story of the Sydney games revolves around an incredible haul of gold, silver and bronze medals, with Britain climbing to 10th in the medal table.In the middle of it all was the man who once managed Eddie ‘The Eagle’ Edwards and who now had an audacious dream of Britain rising to the honoured position of one day hosting the games.

Gracie opened his outstanding professional MMA career by recording nine consecutive wins over  previously undefeated opponents, including eight by submission. His opponent Storley has lost just once in his 13-fight career, with the only blemish on his record a nail-biting, split decision loss to reigning division champion Yaroslav Amosov. The bout promises to produce fireworks as both fighters aim to strengthen their title credentials in the stacked welterweight division. The card’s co-main event sees another huge welterweight clash with former Bellator world champion Andrey Koreshkov opening his 2022 campaign against returning veteran Chance Rencountre. Russian Koreshkov shut down the highly rated Sabah Homasi by unanimous decision to notch his 24th win in his most recent fight at Bellator 264 last August. Meanwhile, Rencountre will be hoping to extend his two-bout win streak when he fights under the Bellator banner for the first time in more than four years. The 35-year-old American boasts an impressive career professional record of 16 wins from his 20 fights. Elsewhere on the main card is an all-American bout between 44-fight veteran Georgi Karakhanyan and Adam Piccolotti in the lightweight division. Karakhanyan will be aiming to notch an incredible 32nd victory in a career which has spanned 16 years. His opponent Piccolotti has won 12 of his 16 bouts and will be looking to bounce back from a split-decision loss to Sidney Outlaw in his most recent fight at Bellator 244. Rounding out the main card is a heavyweight fight between the undefeated Davion Franklin and Surinames’s Said Sowma. Plenty is on the line as the fighters come into the bout tied at eighth in Bellator’s heavyweight rankings, with the winner set to establish himself as one of the division’s top contenders. Sowma will be hoping to continue his fine form having produced back-to-back knockouts in 2021, against Ronny Markes and most recently Vitaly Minakov at Bellator 269 in Moscow.  Elsewhere on an evening of high-class MMA action Connecticut’s Brennan Ward will be hoping the home support will aide him on his return to the cage following a five year lay-off when he takes on Brandon Bell. DeAnna Bennett welcomes Justine Kish to the Bellator cage at women’s flyweight and in the light heavyweight division Kevin Haley makes his promotional debut against top prospect Christian Edwards. All the action comes live from the Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, Connecticut.

In the shadow of the civil rights movement and the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing - until the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. Derry City FC was banned from playing at home and eventually went out of business.In 1984, the city needed a saviour. Tony O’Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international, Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin, to become the Gang of Four who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown. With repeated rebuffs from the Irish League in Belfast to their requests to gain re-entry, the four lads decided to take their footballing revolution south to the League of Ireland in Dublin. This film charts the emotional journey of how in 1985, after 13 years in the wilderness, football returned to the Brandywell. The club would go on to lift both silverware and the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism.Featuring interviews with the Gang of Four, rare archive footage and memories of the faithful supporters, the film portrays an inspirational group of people who made their dreams come true. The rollercoaster took the club and community from the depths of despair to footballing nirvana, landing a historic domestic treble in the League of Ireland. It would culminate with the arrival of football royalty with Sven-Goran Eriksson bringing his Benfica team of superstars into the heart of the Bogside for a European Cup tie.

His legendary 60-yard wonder goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon becomes the moment that changes his life.In this episode we explore the rise of the celebrity footballer, symbolised by Beckham in the mid ‘90s. He’s part of a much-feted new breed of footballers who are starting to resemble rock stars more than sportsmen. When Beckham starts a relationship with ‘Posh Spice’ Victoria Adams, the pair are catapulted onto the pages of every gossip column.But for every David Beckham there has to be a casualty who isn’t quite so fortunate.Keith Gillespie was once dubbed ‘the new George Best’ and yet his journey through the 90s couldn’t be more divergent from that of David Beckham. The pair had been friends and were both members of United’s so-called Class of 92 who went on to form the backbone of their success through the next decadeAfter a whirlwind start at Manchester United, Gillespie was deemed surplus to requirements and off-loaded to title rivals Newcastle United. While there was no drop in his form, the loneliness of living in a strange town away from the Man United youth team players he’d grown up with, led Gillespie to seek solace in the local bookmakers.  In another era Gillespie may have been able to ask for help but his gambling habit went from bad to worse before he was inevitably “outed’ by a tabloid newspaper. On the pitch, Gillespie and Beckham each have their sights set on their first Premier League winners medal. The 1995/96 season concludes with a dramatic showdown – either Newcastle or Manchester United side will be crowned champions on the final day.

Thanks to Luciano Pavarotti’s rendition of Nessun Dorma and the superb footballing stages of Rome, Milan, Naples and Turin, it became known as ‘The Beautiful Tournament’.In four short weeks during the summer of 1990, English football was transformed.After dark years of hooliganism and tragedy, the game in England was revitalised by the performance of the national team at that summer’s World Cup, and a love affair with football was rekindled.Gazza’s tears, Gary Lineker’s goals and a gripping penalty shoot out all contributed to a football story which increasingly gripped the nation.Meanwhile, the Italians had their own rising star in the form of Toto Schillaci, who would go on to win the Golden Boot as tournament top scorer. And Cameroon became world sensations, beating former champions Argentina and taking England all the way in a dramatic quarter-final.Return to Turin - Italia '90 recounts one of the greatest of World Cups, told through the eyes of Gary Lineker, Terry Butcher, Paul Parker, Chris Waddle, John Barnes, Toto Schillaci, Roger Milla and Lothar Matthaus.

In 1976, Caitlyn – then known as Bruce – won Decathlon gold at the Montreal Olympics. She was called 'the world's greatest athlete'. Fame and adulation followed, but gender dysphoria – where there's a mismatch between someone's biological sex and their gender identity – was always bubbling away under the surface. In 2015, Caitlyn finally came out as a transgender woman. In this programme, Simon Mundie and Caitlyn discuss some of the lessons she has learnt during her incredible life. They talk about the importance of honesty and being true to yourself and your family around you, and about not judging a book by its cover, as someone who apparently has it all may well be suffering inside. It’s all about the challenges you overcome, not the heights you attain.

Sirrell had his eye set on another race at the festival but missed the deadline, and the only race left to enter was the Gold Cup. Trained in the mountains and beaches of west Wales through unorthodox methods, Sirrell's horse, Norton’s Coin, was gearing up to shock the racing world.Sirrell was a permit holder, which meant he could only train his own horses, so whilst professionals were training with 60 horses at a time, Sirrell had just three horses in his stable. We retell this true underdog story of the 100 to 1 shot that won the 1990 Cheltenham Gold Cup. With interviews from Sirrell and the Griffiths family, the winning jockey, Graham McCourt and renowned rider Richard Dunwoody.

But it was the antics of the unpredictable Ulstersman and snooker genius, Higgins, that took the game stratospheric.Raw and unpredictable on the table, outspoken and badly behaved off it, Higgins declared war on the 1970s snooker establishment, entering into a years-long rivalry with the man who more than anyone embodied the old guard, ex-policeman Ray Reardon. Higgins and Reardon didn’t see eye to eye, but it was well known that Higgins could start a fight in an empty room. As the 70s wore on, the tabloids gleefully reported on a string of on- and off-the-table misdeeds.Almost inevitably, Reardon and Higgins eventually came face to face in the World Championship final of 1982, in what was by far the biggest tournament to date. The clash of the two snooker titans - the paragon of the establishment against the self-described ‘People’s Champion’ - would be the match that redefined the British public’s relationship with the sport and set the course for a decade where it would become box office gold.
Sports;Real Kashmir FC;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Real Kashmir FC;Former Rangers and Aberdeen star Davie Robertson moves to India to manage Real Kashmir FC.;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07k2xtl.jpg;58 mins;3473;26 Feb 2019;Former Rangers and Aberdeen star Davie Robertson moves to India to manage Real Kashmir FC.;Former Aberdeen and Rangers star Davie Robertson has left everything behind and moved to India to manage Real Kashmir FC. It's football in the danger zone, can he make it work?;Former Aberdeen, Rangers and Leeds United stalwart Davie Robertson is a long way from home. In fact, he is a long way from anywhere. He is the new manager of Real Kashmir FC, and he has left behind his wife and the millionaire lifestyle he earned from football, to live in a shared house in a city that regularly suffers violent protests and terrorist attacks.Why? What is it about football that drives him so far to be the manager of Real Kashmir FC? For Davie it’s because few things in life can match the highs and lows of football. Real Kashmir are up-and-comers, newly promoted to a league where most of the other teams have much deeper pockets, more fans and a longer history. To beat them Davie must put into action his 'masterplan'. But against the background of chaos in Jammu and Kashmir will it ever work? In a place where violent protests erupt most weekends, the electricity is routinely switched off - meaning no internet, phones, or television - even the basics can be a struggle, so organising and motivating a diverse team drawn from India, Africa and Europe to play top-flight football is no easy task. 'Some of the boys pray at different times, some are vegetarian so telling them about a proper diet and running a schedule where everyone is there is always difficult. All the different religions pray at different times!'However, this is not just a footballing story it's also a story of hopes, dreams, and family. Davie's obsession with football has driven him to the ends of the earth, and in amongst the struggle for success on the field he has to learn to live in very unfamiliar world, far from his wife Kym. Davie's used to the comforts his success in football brought him. With Kym and his two children he enjoyed living in the States - where he moved after his playing career came to an early end - but his son, Mason, is now a regular in the Real Kashmir team, living in Srinagar near his father. Together they have a chance to explore a part of the world that is both stunningly beautiful and so riven with violence that the UK's Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the team's home base in Srinagar.Kym worries about Davie and Mason living and working in a conflict zone. When Davie announced that the move to Kashmir was a possibilty Kym - a self-confessed football widow - says only half joking that 'divorce was considered'. 'David came in with the Real Kashmir deal and tried to sell it to me. I'm like 'no, not doing it'. So we didn't speak and then on New Year's Eve 2016 David got on a plane to India!'.As the new season - the first since Davie helped Real Kashmir secure promotion to the Indian 'I' League - starts Davie needs to make sure his team believes they can win. It is here that manager can lift ordinary players into world-beaters. As each big game approaches everything needs to be right. He has lifted his team before and gotten them promoted but can they succeed in the new league? Is Davie's masterplan for success is going to work? Has what it takes to be a manager.

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer. In We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UK’s most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. It’s never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but it’s a question they’ll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.   Because instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and today’s top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team – itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been – and many of the country’s biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the ‘cages’ of the UK’s estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.   So if they’re going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, it’s these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings and West Ham’s Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St George’s Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients he’d like to see making it into the final song.

Davis was the polar opposite of people’s champion Alex Higgins: slow, precise and intent on grinding out victories rather than entertaining with risky flair shots. Hearn was certain that his young apprentice was a future world champion, and together, the pair plotted world domination. As Higgins’s career took a downward turn, Davis quickly became a winning machine, bagging trophy after trophy. But his 'robotic' performances failed to win over a crowd who preferred their sporting heroes more flawed and unpredictable.Capitalising on Davis’s success, Hearn started to build his own snooker empire - the 'Matchroom’- and recruited a small group of players he could mould and market, creating a soap opera out of sporting rivalry, and in the process, bringing lucrative sponsorships (and even hit pop singles) into the game.By the mid-80s, snooker was at the peak of its powers, and in 1985 nearly 20 million people tuned in to see Steve Davis play Dennis Taylor in the World Championship final. It was an encounter that became known as the 'black ball final’, widely believed to be the best snooker match of all time. After that, Britain really did go 'snooker loopy', and a select group of cue-wielding sportsmen were suddenly the biggest superstars in the country.

Filmed during the new management’s first season in charge of the club, the documentary follows the struggles of the Highland League side on and off the pitch and the lives of the locals for whom the club means so much.For a long time FWFC have been bad, really bad. Serial losers. They have finished bottom of the Highland League (the fifth tier of Scottish football) for 14 of the past 20 years. The team has not won a match for a very long time, something that has helped them achieve cult status across social media. Now they face an existential crisis.In the summer of 2018, after a winless season, the board of directors, made up of local business owners and volunteers, all stepped down. Having devoted their lives and invested significant time and money in the club for five years they had decided enough was enough. The end was near for the club that had fought so hard to gain entry to the Highland League back in 1985.Most in the town have no interest whatsoever in their football team. Many FWFC players have to make seven-hour round trips on match day, travelling from Skye, Inverness and beyond. Shinty is the most popular game in the area and the first choice sport for most local young people, making player recruitment a huge problem for FWFC, but not their only one.The disparity of wealth in the league could not be greater. The top teams buy players for transfer fees up to £40,000 while FWFC players receive a £20 match fee and a likely loss by a similar number of goals. There is a win bonus, but in recent years it is not something the club have ever needed to pay, perhaps mercifully for their meagre accounts. Average match attendance, at one of the rainiest but most scenic grounds in the country, is 60-70 people. This occasionally includes the odd football fanatic who has travelled hundreds of miles to see 'the worst team in Britain', a title the club's new management have high hopes of changing.At the start of the 2019/20 season the club was handed a lifeline. A group of locals, with no previous experience running a football club, stepped in to take over management of FWFC. They want to reverse the rot and return the team to winning ways. They spent their summer putting a new team together, recruiting a manager and starting to renovate the dilapidated old clubhouse. It is a work in progress.Despite the numerous challenges, FWFC is a surprisingly optimistic place. It is hard not to fall in love with the location and the people. There is a genuine belief the club can turn things around. What drives those involved to persevere with what many see as a hopeless, embarrassing existence? This is the question explored at the heart of the film through its central cast of characters.As well as providing an entertaining 'warts and all’ insider's view of the workings of a struggling football club, the film explores the cast's daily lives in the Scottish highlands. Club secretary Russell has experienced psychological trauma from his work as a police officer. Club director Woody mixes football with farming a croft and catering for tourists at his holiday caravan park on the shores of Loch Eil, whilst committee member Mikey is striving to rid himself of gambling addiction to become a better single father, juggling time with the kids and working shifts at the area’s biggest employer, the local aluminium plant.The characters represent a region defined by its picturesque location and the industries that feed off the country’s biggest mountain.The Fort is a warm, funny and emotive portrait of a real community at work in pursuit of its passion - despite, or perhaps because of their football club's many existential challenges.

For the first time, Barney tells the incredible story, in his own words, of how he managed to take £2m (inflation-adjusted) off the bookies in one eventful hurdle race in 1975 - without breaking the law. With access to the bookmakers and the jockey, as well as stars of racing such as Frankie Dettori and Ian Balding, this is the definitive story of one of the great characters of the turf.Barney went on to win many other massive bets, famously raffling his mansion and as recently as 2016 making millions from a carefully planned accumulator bet.

As his side pose a serious challenge to Man United’s dominance, the league’s most infamous feud is born.;Having won four out of five titles since the start of the Premier League, Manchester United and Alex Ferguson seem unstoppable. In London, Arsenal have barely had a look-in, but vice chairman David Dein has been busy plotting.He introduces an unknown bespectacled Frenchman to the waiting press at Highbury and announces that he is Arsenal’s new manager. Arsene Wenger looks more like a history teacher than a football manager, and the players have never heard of him. Yet Wenger is about to have a huge impact, not just on the Premier League but on English football, by introducing modern coaching techniques as well as lifestyle and dietary improvements.The first thing he does is put a stop to the drinking culture – the players’ ‘Tuesday Club’ is consigned to history. He also brings in exciting foreign players from Europe - Patrick Vieira, Marc Overmars, Nicolas Anelka - to play alongside Arsenal stalwarts like captain Tony Adams. On the pitch, Arsenal are turbo-charged, and it’s not long before Alex Ferguson feels the imminent threat, a new rival intent on destroying the legacy he’s building at Manchester United. It’s clear Ferguson is rattled by the new interloper, and the rivalry and tension between the two men is replicated by the players when the two sides meet. It marks the beginning of a ten-year chapter in the Premier league which would become known as The Feud.But off the pitch, Manchester United’s supporters have another battle on their hands – this time in the boardroom. Sky’s Rupert Murdoch announces an audacious £623m bid to buy the club, which has been accepted by the shareholders. Large swathes of United’s fans are incensed and launch a desperate rear-guard action to try and fight the sale of their beloved club.

Jade, her friends, her family and her trainers reveal how a troubled youth dominated by shoplifting and problems at school was transformed through her love of sport. Nothing has come easy for her - she even had to raise money to pay for training by cockle fishing in the mud flats near her home and by selling scrap metal with her dad. Now she stands on the brink of unprecedented sporting success, and missing out on a third gold in Japan is simply not an option.

On one side were Barry Hearn’s ‘Matchroom Mob’, including Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis: clean-living, utterly professional and family friendly. In sharp contrast was a group that included Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Kirk Stevens, who all embraced a more rock-and-roll lifestyle.With Higgins’s career quickly spiralling out of control, Jimmy White was next in line to take the crown of ‘people’s champion’. But Jimmy also had an insatiable appetite for the highlife and a string of vices – including cocaine and crack - that threatened to overshadow his raw talent and enormous potential.Twelve years younger than Alex, Jimmy soon realised that Alex’s popularity and ability was at odds with his success in the game, having won only two world championship trophies in a sport many thought he should dominate. Indeed, Steve Davis had quickly become the world number one through practice and discipline and had suddenly become the man to beat. Desperate for success and tempted by the lucrative rewards brought by towing the line, Jimmy joined Barry Hearn in the hope he could be turned into a champion like his new stablemate, Steve Davis.Jimmy began the 90s clean and well-prepared and got his best opportunity yet to win his first world championship, coming up against a young emerging Scotsman called Stephen Hendry. With White as the hot favourite and with the crowd urging him on, the 1990 final turned out to be a pivotal moment in British snooker and paved the way for what was to come in the next decade.

In the storm that followed, hundreds of men made allegations against hundreds of their childhood coaches. The first episode of the series begins with Andy’s momentous revelation, then goes back in time to the 1970s to hear from former players Paul Stewart and David White as they describe growing up in Manchester with dreams of becoming footballers. Talented young players, they were soon picked up by respective local talent-spotters Barry Bennell and Frank Roper. It was the beginning of the nightmare for Paul and David - and for many other survivors. The programme charts these survivors from the years of abuse during their early adolescence, then explores how it affected them as they tried to pursue their footballing dreams as professionals. Whether Steve Walters starring as a youngster at Crewe or David White playing for Man City or Paul Stewart scoring in the FA Cup final for Spurs, they all feel they couldn’t enjoy their career highs because of the heavy burden of the mental scars they were carrying.

Having unexpectedly come fourth in Beijing, to do even better at London meant defeating one of the three ‘untouchable’ sporting superpowers: the USA, China and Russia. The athletes would have to put in the performances of their lives.  To boost our chances, the Sporting Giants programme sought to expand our pool of potential medal winners by turning amateurs into elite competitors. Helen Glover was plucked from teacher training and given a shot at Olympic rowing glory. At the same time, the Mission 2012 tracking system monitored sports’ progress towards inescapable medal targets. With so much money on the line, the scrutiny seemed prudent, but at what cost to the athletes who struggled under the immense pressure?  With the eyes of the world on London, 2012 would be a milestone year for the Paralympics – an opportunity to transform the perception of Paralympians as elite athletes and to demonstrate how far the movement had come since the empty stands at Atlanta 16 years earlier.  Featuring interviews with Victoria Pendleton, Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Mo Farah, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Helen Glover, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Nicola Adams and Ellie Simmonds, as well as former prime minister David Cameron, this film tells the story of the lengths we went to in search of Olympic glory, and the costs – paid in personal sacrifice – that made the gold rush possible.

Northumbria Police have begun their own investigation, alongside those already taking place in the north west and Southampton. We hear the dramatic tale of former footballer Derek Bell, who confronted Ormond hoping to secretly record a confession from his abuser on a tape recorder hidden in his pocket. The film asks what justice might look like for the men and their families, whose lives have been torn apart by the devastating effects of childhood sexual abuse over so many years. As the three trials come to a head, why has it taken so long to reach this point? The long-awaited FA inquiry continues to be delayed, and across the country there have been denials and even pay-offs by clubs. It is no wonder that football’s darkest secret has remained hidden for so many years, and it is only thanks to the courage and persistence of the survivors that we are finally able to shine some light on it now.

The number 10 in rugby is arguably the most important player on the pitch. They are the master tactician and the playmaker, the goal kicker and the person who calls the shots. The number 10 shirt carries responsibility, respect and a sense of prestige and the pressure is intense both on and off the pitch. It’s the Irish fascination with the selection of who should wear the number 10 shirt which has produced great debate across the decades and created some of the most intense rivalries in world sport, such as that between Ollie Campbell and Tony Ward or Ronan O’Gara and David Humphreys. As the shirt is passed from one player to another and one generation to the next, we explore some of Ireland’s best ever number 10s, examine why the iconic shirt is so important and reflect on many of the most memorable moments in Irish rugby history.

Having finished fourth and then second to United, he and manager Kenny Dalglish are determined to go one better. With a personal fortune of £360 million, he has the money and the appetite to spend his way to success. After buying Alan Shearer for a British transfer record, he goes one better and smashes it again by signing Chris Sutton for £5m. But the rapid injection of money into the game – players’ salaries are hitting £10,000 a week - is starting to create a ‘them and us’ divide with the fans.The David and Goliath title race between Blackburn and United is too close to call until one cold January night halfway through the season, when Eric Cantona launches himself into the terraces of Selhurst Park and kung-fu kicks a Crystal Palace supporter who’s verbally abused him. It’s reported Cantona has been provoked by a racist slur, but his actions cause national outrage, and the threat of a prison term looms for the mercurial Frenchman.Despite the repackaging of football and the fanfare of the new Premier League, the sinister underbelly of racism remains.

Much more accessible than any other motorsport, stock car racing is raw and unfiltered. Competitors don't race stock cars to be rich or famous, they race to win.Cowdenbeath Racewall has long been regarded as one of the fastest and most feared tracks in the UK. With the final race weekend of the season approaching, it is the last chance for Scotland's best drivers to show they have what it takes, and they are going to give it everything they have. Both on and off the track, drivers dedicate a huge amount of time and energy looking for an elusive podium finish - but who will finish the season on a high?The stock car racing community is small, and rivalries run deep between drivers, families and fans. This is epitomised by Scotland's two most successful drivers - Chris Burgoyne and Gordon Moodie. Gordon and Chris have been racing against each other for more than 20 years, and the desire to win is only getting stronger.Gordon holds the record for the most wins in the Brisca Formula 2 category. He is extremely focused and dedicated to the sport he loves, going above and beyond to finish first, even going as far as starving himself to make his car lighter and give himself a competitive edge. However, due to illness, Gordon has been absent for much of the season, causing him to fall behind his main rival, Chris Burgoyne.Current world champion Chris is a family man and comes from an incredibly successful racing dynasty. The Burgoynes have competed and won across many different stock car formulas, and now the pressure to carry on that legacy falls on his shoulders. This year has seen Chris win the World Championship for the second time in his career, but now Gordon is back to full health and, with the final race of the season coming up, he has everything to lose.Unlike most motorsports, stock car racing sees men and women compete together, and for 17-year-old Taylor Borthwick this is a big year. After dominating in her junior formula, Taylor is now old enough to be racing against the adults. With her last race imminent, will she be able to establish herself in this competitive new field?

It follows the investigation into former Southampton youth coach Bob Higgins, filming alongside Hampshire Police detectives as they conduct interviews with Higgins and the survivors. A deeply disturbing pattern of psychological manipulation and sexual grooming begins to emerge.Higgins was the subject of a police investigation in the early 1990s, but the subsequent trial resulted in acquittal. Barry Bennell was first convicted in Florida in 1995. He and Higgins were the subject of a Dispatches documentary back in 1997, for which Dean Radford and Ian Ackley bravely waived their anonymity in order to discuss what had happened to them then. And yet the response to the Dispatches programme was deafening silence. How was it that, after such public scrutiny, the true scale of the offending was able to remain hidden? Back in the present day, a new investigation into Higgins comes to a head. Dean hopes and prays that, 30 years on, history won’t repeat itself.

In this programme, he sets out to understand why his life has been so badly blighted by gambling and explores the relationship between football and gambling at a time when it has never been more urgent to question the industry’s place in the world of sport.Now on the path to recovery, he wants to understand what caused his addiction. Could it be the way his brain is wired, his environment or both? Paul sets out to meet old teammates, scientists and psychologists to see if he can get close to finding the answer. He starts by meeting former Arsenal teammate Wes Reid. When they received their first pay cheques as Arsenal trainees, Paul and Wes went to the bookies, and Paul lost his entire week’s wages in 15 minutes, kicking off a 35-year struggle with gambling. Paul also meets footballers Keith Gillespie, John Hartson and Scott Davies, who between them gambled away £15 million, and he visits the families of three men who took their own lives as a result of gambling addiction. At Imperial College London, he talks to Dr David Erritzoe, a consultant psychiatrist whose team of researchers are mapping the brain, trying to pinpoint the neurobiological basis of gambling addiction so that new treatments can be developed. As the government considers whether gambling laws should be reformed to protect those addicted to gambling, Paul wonders if an entire generation of young Brits is at risk of following the same dangerous path that he trod. Advertising and sponsorship by betting firms have exploded in recent years, with more than a third of English Premier League clubs promoting gambling companies on their shirts.

Pressure rises on all sides, not only to deliver medals, but to win London’s Olympic bid.;After the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Britain failed to move up from tenth position in the medal table at the Athens games in 2004. Increasingly reliant on a generation of ageing champions, it was time for our younger hopes to step up and deliver. And to ensure that funding delivered results, UK Sport introduced a no compromise approach, meaning that all funded athletes needed to start winning medals.The pressure was on for youngster Tom Daley to step up to the big time, but as a nine-year-old away from home, it was the nights alone that were the hardest. Christine Ohuruogu, the potential face of the 2012 games, describes her dramatic fall from grace after missing three drugs tests, and her subsequent return to the track. And after no male gymnasts were even fielded in Athens, Louis Smith became the first British man to win an individual gymnastics medal in a hundred years at the Beijing games in 2008. His win finally achieved funding for his beloved sport.  With a haul of 51 medals achieved at the epic Beijing games, Britain was finally showing its mettle, but could we continue to fund sport at the increasing rates needed, and would we succumb to the critics and embarrass ourselves on home turf four years later?
